> Can you tell me more about yourself?

### `05_AriaResponse`

`05_AriaResponse01.wav`
> More about me? Well, let's see... I'm a product of the colonies. A tiny speck on the edge of the frontier that you won't find on any tourist brochure. The scrapyard was my playground,
> I dreamt of one day inventing something big and important, something that would propel humanity forward. My folks figured I'd be a mechanic, but I had my eyes on the stars and my mind on the ships that could reach them.
> So, I made it off-world, thanks to a scholarship at the University here. It was my shot, my big break. I was going to build the future. But the corporate shipyards weren't buying what a starry-eyed colony kid was selling.
> But then, Atlas Astronautics happened. A startup with ambition and, more importantly, a willingness to gamble on a wildcard like me. They needed someone who could think outside the proverbial box—or ship, in this case. So I jumped ship—literally—and it's been a wild ride since.
> I'm not just building ships here. I'm building dreams—my dreams—into every hull, every thruster array. And yeah, I miss home sometimes, but this place... it's where I can make a real impact. It's where I belong.
> And when things get too serious, I just remind myself that no matter how advanced our tech gets, we're still a bunch of primates trying to figure out how to not crash into the nearest celestial body. It's grounding, in an anti-gravity sort of way.

### `10_AriaResponseToSupportive`

`10_AriaResponseToSupportive01.wav`

_She offers a small, contemplative smile._

`11_AriaResponseToUnderstanding01.wav`
> I suppose you're right. It wouldn't hurt to stop and look around once in a while. There's more to life than just the next achievement.

### `11_AriaResponseToPractical`

> Any unique hobbies outside of your ship work?

### `13_AriaResponse`

`13_AriaResponse01.wav`
> I've taken up cooking. I'm no chef, mind you. Half the time, it's more of an experiment than a meal. But there's something satisfying about creating with your hands, even if it's just a quirky sandwich.
> And I dabble in amateur astronomy. I’m not particularly great at it – I can barely tell the constellations apart! But gazing at the stars, not as a designer but just as myself, it's kind of liberating.

### `13_AriaResponseToLightTease`
_Her laughter is genuine, tinged with a hint of embarrassment._

`13_AriaResponseToLightTease01.wav`

### `13_AriaResponseToUnderstanding`
_She nods appreciatively, a reflective look in her eyes._

`13_AriaResponseToUnderstanding01.wav`

> It's good to aim high, but remember, the greatest legacies are often the unexpected impacts, the ripples we create.

### `14_PlayerResponseConcern`

### `15_AriaResponseToSupportive`
_Her expression brightens, reaffirming her path._

`15_AriaResponseToSupportive01.wav`
> Thank you. I’ve never been one for the sidelines. I'm here to make waves, to make a difference.

### `15_AriaResponseToIntimate`

> How has your career affected ties with family?

### `16_AriaResponse`
_Aria's facade momentarily slips, revealing a raw, emotional undercurrent._

`16_AriaResponse01.wav`
> It's... it's been hard. I've been so wrapped up in my work, I've let those connections fade. It's one of those things you don't notice until it hits you.

### `16_PlayerResponseDismissive`

`16_PlayerResponseDismissive01.wav`
> Well, sacrifices are part of the job, right? You can’t reach the stars without leaving something behind.

### `16_AriaResponseToCompassionate`
_The vulnerability in Aria’s voice is palpable, her usual confidence replaced by a rare sense of fear._

`16_AriaResponseToCompassionate01.wav`
> You might be right, but... it terrifies me. The thought of reaching out after all this time, facing them... it feels like standing on the edge of a black hole. I don't know if I'm ready to confront that darkness yet.

### `16_AriaResponseToPractical`
_There's a shift in her demeanor, a mix of acceptance and hesitation._

`16_AriaResponseToPractical01.wav`

### `16_AriaResponseToProbing`
_A brief flicker of contemplation crosses her face, then she retreats slightly._

`16_AriaResponseToProbing01.wav`

### `16_AriaResponseToDismissive`
_Her defenses snap back up, the vulnerability gone._

`16_AriaResponseToDismissive01.wav`
