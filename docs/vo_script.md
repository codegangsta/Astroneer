### `01_AriaIntro`

`[01_AriaIntro01]`
Whoa, an intercom call? That's a rare vintage. Aria here—your ship-building maestro and Atlas Astronautics' semi-official welcome wagon.
Let's talk ship. You're about to dive into the nuts and bolts of starship customization. I'll transfer the bare bones to your hangar, and you put the soul into the machine. Match the contract specs, and we're golden.
Once you're done, bring her back so we can give her the old spaceworthy stamp. Keep your sensors peeled out there—your handiwork will be zipping around the galaxy before you know it.
Got questions, or floating in confusion? Buzz me on this line. I'm like a walking, talking encyclopedia of space oddities, minus the boring parts.
I hear you're quite the pilot. So I'm calling you 'Cap' from here on out! Beats saying 'O Great Shipbuilder' every time, right?
Alright, Cap. Aria signing off—don't be a stranger, or do, but come back with stories!

Hello from Aria's isolation station! If I start making spaceship noises, just go with it.


`[02_AriaGreetingFunny02]`
Atlas’s remote ship designer here, where my biggest debate is talking to the toaster or the TV. What’s your crisis?


`[02_AriaGreetingFunny03]`
Day 47 in the apartment wilderness, and I've started assigning starship roles to my furniture. What can I do for you?


`[02_AriaGreetingFunny04]`
Reporting from Fort Couch Cushion. If I don't design something soon, I might start crafting a spaceship out of pillows. Help?

Hey, Cap! Ready to swap my solo monologue for some actual dialogue. What’s on the drawing board?

Aria, reporting from the homefront! I'm one cup of coffee away from teaching my plant astrophysics. What's on the agenda?

Your trusty starship engineer, now doubling as an apartment explorer. Found anything interesting out there in the real world?

Broadcasting live from Aria’s space station (aka my kitchen). Let's talk ships before I start making rocket ships out of cutlery.

Here’s an explorer that's craving adventure. Ready to be its genie?

### `03_AriaHauler`

`[03_AriaHauler01]`

`[03_AriaHauler02]`
There's a sturdy hauler here. Could use a touch of pizzazz. Fancy giving it some sparkle?


`[03_AriaHauler03]`
Here's a freighter with dreams of being a starship. Think you can grant its wish?


`[03_AriaHauler04]`
This old freighter's solid but could use some fun. How about disco lights in the cargo bay?


`[03_AriaHauler05]`
There’s a hauler here with space to spare. Maybe add a bowling alley?

`[03_AriaInterceptor01]`
Interceptor in the bay is ready for some zing. Think you can make it zoom and boom?

There’s a need-for-speed ship here. Think you can make it go 'vroom' with style?


`[03_AriaInterceptor04]`
An interceptor's lined up. It’s fast, but can you make it furious?


`[03_AriaInterceptor05]`
Here's a racer that's been dreaming of rocket boosters. Fancy turning it into a speed demon?

### `03_AriaLuxury`

`[04_AriaHauler05]`
Wow, talk about an upgrade! It's a planet mover!

`[04_AriaInterceptor01]`

## Scene 5: Aria's Background

### `05_PlayerInquiry`

`[05_PlayerInquiry01]`
Can you tell me more about yourself?

### `05_AriaResponse`

`[05_AriaResponse01]`
More about me? Well, let's see... I'm a product of the colonies. A tiny speck on the edge of the frontier that you won't find on any tourist brochure. The scrapyard was my playground, I dreamt of one day inventing something big and important, something that would propel humanity forward. My folks figured I'd be a mechanic, but I had my eyes on the stars and my mind on the ships that could reach them.
So, I made it off-world, thanks to a scholarship at the University here. It was my shot, my big break. I was going to build the future. But the corporate shipyards weren't buying what a starry-eyed colony kid was selling.
But then, Atlas Astronautics happened. A startup with ambition and, more importantly, a willingness to gamble on a wildcard like me. They needed someone who could think outside the proverbial box—or ship, in this case. So I jumped ship—literally—and it's been a wild ride since.
I'm not just building ships here. I'm building dreams—my dreams—into every hull, every thruster array. And yeah, I miss home sometimes, but this place... it's where I can make a real impact. It's where I belong.
And when things get too serious, I just remind myself that no matter how advanced our tech gets, we're still a bunch of primates trying to figure out how to not crash into the nearest celestial body. It's grounding, in an anti-gravity sort of way.

---

## Scene 6: Player's Background

### `06_AriaInquiry`

`[06_AriaInquiry01]`
So, Cap, what's your story? Here for the thrill, the cash, or something more?

### `06_PlayerResponseAmbition`

`[06_PlayerResponseAmbition01]`
I'm all about the adventure. And hey, the money's a nice bonus.

### `06_PlayerResponseKinship`

`[06_PlayerResponseKinship01]`
Got big dreams, like you. I want to leave my mark out here.

### `06_PlayerResponseHorizon`

`[06_PlayerResponseHorizon01]`
I'm chasing what's beyond the horizon. Always looking further.

### `06_AriaResponseToAmbition`

`[06_AriaResponseToAmbition01]`
Thrills and bills, a classic mix. Just watch your back; adventure can be costly out here.

### `06_AriaResponseToKinship`

`[06_AriaResponseToKinship01]`
Another star chaser, huh? Good. The galaxy's vast, and there's plenty of room for names like ours.

### `06_AriaResponseToHorizon`

`[06_AriaResponseToHorizon01]`
The eternal explorer, huh? Good choice. There's more out there than we can imagine. Let's uncover it together.

## Scene 7: Colony Life

_Notes: In this scene, Aria fondly recalls her upbringing in a space colony, subtly hinting at the contrast between her ambitious career path and the simpler life she left behind. Her responses subtly reflect her inner conflict, though she remains somewhat steadfast in her choices._
### `07_PlayerInquiry`

`[07_PlayerInquiry01]`
Growing up on a colony must have been unique. How did that shape who you are today?

### `07_AriaResponse`

`[07_AriaResponse01]`
It was a mix of hardship and creativity. Building dreams out of scraps, I always knew there was more out there for me. I miss the simplicity at times, but the stars called louder than the past.
Life there was about making do and dreaming big. I learned to be resourceful, to see potential in everything. It's a part of me, but there's a part that always yearned for something... more.

### `07_PlayerResponseAdmireImagination`

`[07_PlayerResponseAdmireImagination01]`
Sounds like it was the perfect breeding ground for your creativity and drive.

### `07_PlayerResponseCuriousImagination`

`[07_PlayerResponseCuriousImagination01]`
Do you think your childhood dreams pushed you to pursue such ambitious goals?

### `07_PlayerResponseAdmireResilience`

`[07_PlayerResponseAdmireResilience01]`
Your resilience is inspiring. From small beginnings to grand achievements.

### `07_PlayerResponseCuriousResilience`

`[07_PlayerResponseCuriousResilience01]`
It seems like your roots gave you both the strength and vision for your journey.

### `07_AriaResponseToAdmireImagination`

`[07_AriaResponseToAdmireImagination01]`
Definitely. My imagination took root there, but it always stretched towards the stars. Can't help but wonder sometimes though, about the roads not taken.

### `07_AriaResponseToCuriousImagination`

`[07_AriaResponseToCuriousImagination01]`
They did. I was always reaching for the next big thing. I guess a part of me still clings to those simple days, even if I don't admit it often.

### `07_AriaResponseToAdmireResilience`

`[07_AriaResponseToAdmireResilience01]`
It's been quite the journey. I've come far, but the lessons from back then keep me grounded... in a way.

## Scene 8: Startup vs Corporations

_Notes: In this scene, Aria explains her choice of leaving a stable corporate job for a dynamic startup environment, subtly indicating her personal drive and aspiration despite the inherent risks._
### `08_PlayerInquiry`

`[08_PlayerInquiry01]`
Why leave the stability of a big corporation for a startup?

### `08_AriaResponse`

`[08_AriaResponse01]`
In corporations, you're a cog in a vast machine. I needed more than that. I wanted to create, to have my designs mean something more than just profit.
Atlas Astronautics? It's uncharted territory, full of risk, sure, but alive with potential. It's not just a job; it's a chance to make real impact, to innovate.

### `08_PlayerResponseUnderstandingCorporate`

`[08_PlayerResponseUnderstandingCorporate01]`
Seems like you were after something meaningful, not just routine. That's impressive.

### `08_PlayerResponseCriticalCorporate`

`[08_PlayerResponseCriticalCorporate01]`
But there's a lot at stake with startups. Aren't you worried about stability?

### `08_PlayerResponseEnthusiasticStartup`

`[08_PlayerResponseEnthusiasticStartup01]`
Risk is part of progress. You must be excited to have that freedom for your ideas.

### `08_PlayerResponseSkepticalStartup`

`[08_PlayerResponseSkepticalStartup01]`
Is it worth the risk, though? How do you balance that with the need for security?

### `08_AriaResponseToUnderstandingCorporate`

`[08_AriaResponseToUnderstandingCorporate01]`
Right. Stability is comforting, but there's no real growth in comfort. At Atlas, every day is a chance to be part of something new, something big.

### `08_AriaResponseToCriticalCorporate`

`[08_AriaResponseToCriticalCorporate01]`
It's a gamble, I won't lie. But sometimes, you have to risk the safety net to reach higher. We might stumble, but we're also free to soar.

### `08_AriaResponseToEnthusiasticStartup`

`[08_AriaResponseToEnthusiasticStartup01]`
Exactly, it's exhilarating! There's this energy here, a buzz of creating something from scratch. That's where true innovation happens.

### `08_AriaResponseToSkepticalStartup`

`[08_AriaResponseToSkepticalStartup01]`
It's a tough call. But I believe in calculated risks. Atlas is a leap, but it's not blind faith. It's about chasing something bigger, something meaningful.

---

## Scene 9: Work Satisfaction

_Notes: Aria talks about her work at Atlas and how she feels about it._
### `09_PlayerInquiry`

`[09_PlayerInquiry01]`
Moving from a big corporation to a startup must be a big change. How do you feel about your work now?

### `09_AriaResponse`

`[09_AriaResponse01]`
It's liberating. I used to follow strict guidelines, but here I get to experiment. It’s thrilling to turn my ideas into reality, even with the ups and downs.
The pressure's real, but it's a good kind. It pushes me to be creative, to really dive into my work. It's tough, but it’s where I see my true potential shine.

### `09_PlayerResponsePraiseFreedom`

`[09_PlayerResponsePraiseFreedom01]`
That sounds empowering. Seeing your own concepts come to life must be incredibly fulfilling.

### `09_PlayerResponseQuestionFreedom`

`[09_PlayerResponseQuestionFreedom01]`
Do you ever find that freedom overwhelming, without the structure of a big company?

### `09_PlayerResponseAdmirePressure`

`[09_PlayerResponseAdmirePressure01]`
Using pressure as a catalyst for creativity? That’s impressive. It shows your dedication.

### `09_PlayerResponseConcernPressure`

`[09_PlayerResponseConcernPressure01]`
It’s great to be driven, but don’t forget to unwind. Balance is key, right?

### `09_AriaResponseToPraiseFreedom`

`[09_AriaResponseToPraiseFreedom01]`
It really is. Every project feels like a part of me is taking off. It’s personal, every win and every challenge.

### `09_AriaResponseToQuestionFreedom`

`[09_AriaResponseToQuestionFreedom01]`
Sometimes, yes. But I prefer it. I thrive in this kind of environment where every day is different, and every challenge is a chance to innovate.

### `09_AriaResponseToAdmirePressure`

`[09_AriaResponseToAdmirePressure01]`
Thanks, I believe in turning challenges into opportunities. It's demanding but seeing my ideas come alive? Worth it.

### `09_AriaResponseToConcernPressure`

`[09_AriaResponseToConcernPressure01]`
Good advice. I try to keep a balance – a moment under the stars can be as refreshing as a day in the workshop. Keeps me grounded.

## Scene 10: Alternate Paths

_Notes: In this scene, Aria reflects on her career choices, showing a blend of confidence in her decision and awareness of what she's left behind. The player's responses probe deeper, revealing Aria's introspective side and her commitment to her path despite acknowledging the trade-offs._
### `10_PlayerInquiry`

`[10_PlayerInquiry01]`
Ever wonder about staying in the corporate world instead of jumping to a startup?

### `10_AriaResponse`

`[10_AriaResponse01]`
Sometimes, I think about it. The corporate route would've been smoother, sure. But then I solve a tough design problem or see my ideas take flight, and I know I chose right. It's these moments that validate my decision.
The 'what ifs' used to bug me more. What if I took the safer route, climbed the corporate ladder? But I prefer the roads less traveled. It’s uncertain, but it feels real, and the rewards are mine to cherish.

### `10_PlayerResponseEncouraging`

`[10_PlayerResponseEncouraging01]`
You’re shaping the future, not just following a preset path. That's a big deal.

### `10_PlayerResponseInquisitive`

`[10_PlayerResponseInquisitive01]`
Do you think the structure of corporate life might have offered different achievements?

### `10_PlayerResponseSupportive`

`[10_PlayerResponseSupportive01]`
Making your own way takes guts. It's inspiring to see where your choices have led.

### `10_PlayerResponseRealistic`

`[10_PlayerResponseRealistic01]`
Leaving stability for the unknown is a bold move. Takes a lot of guts to make that leap.

### `10_AriaResponseToEncouraging`

`[10_AriaResponseToEncouraging01]`
Thanks, that means a lot. It's about making a mark, not just earning a paycheck. I get to see my dreams become reality. That's my kind of success.

### `10_AriaResponseToInquisitive`

`[10_AriaResponseToInquisitive01]`
I've pondered that. Sure, I might have had more resources, but would I have had this much impact? Here, each project is personal, a testament to my journey.

### `10_AriaResponseToSupportive`

`[10_AriaResponseToSupportive01]`
Appreciate that. Yeah, it's risky, but also thrilling. I’m not just a part of something; I’m driving it. That's a feeling worth all the risks.

### `10_AriaResponseToRealistic`

`[10_AriaResponseToRealistic01]`
It was a tough choice, no denying. But I believe in betting on myself. It's not just about risk; it's about potential and making things happen on my terms.

## Scene 11: Reflecting on Personal Growth

_Notes: In this scene, Aria starts off guarded, her usual self-assurance masking deeper uncertainties. As the player engages, she gradually reveals more of her introspective side._
### `11_AriaInquiry`
_Aria, maintaining a composed exterior_

`[11_AriaInquiry01]`
Cap, do you ever think we get so wrapped up in our goals that we miss... life happening around us? Not that I'm second-guessing myself, it's just a thought.

### `11_PlayerResponseUnderstanding`

`[11_PlayerResponseUnderstanding01]`
It's natural to wonder, Aria. Maybe it's not about changing course, but just taking a moment to appreciate where you are.

### `11_PlayerResponsePractical`

`[11_PlayerResponsePractical01]`
Focused as we are, it's easy to lose sight of other things. But balance is important, isn't it?

### `11_PlayerResponseCurious`

`[11_PlayerResponseCurious01]`
That's quite introspective. Are you feeling like you're at a turning point, perhaps?

### `11_PlayerResponseCandid`

`[11_PlayerResponseCandid01]`
Overdrive can make us miss the finer details of life. Maybe slowing down a bit isn't such a bad idea.

### `11_AriaResponseToUnderstanding`
_She offers a small, contemplative smile._

`[11_AriaResponseToUnderstanding01]`
I suppose you're right. It wouldn't hurt to stop and look around once in a while. There's more to life than just the next achievement.

### `11_AriaResponseToPractical`
_With a slight nod, she acknowledges the wisdom._

`[11_AriaResponseToPractical01]`
Balance... That's something I've not been great at. Maybe it's time to recalibrate a little.

### `11_AriaResponseToCurious`
_There's a pause as she ponders._

`[11_AriaResponseToCurious01]`
Turning point? I don't know about that, but it's healthy to question things, right? To make sure we're still on track.

### `11_AriaResponseToCandid`
_Initially bristling, she then concedes._

`[11_AriaResponseToCandid01]`
I've always been pedal to the metal, but you've got a point. Maybe I do need to ease off the accelerator and enjoy the ride more.

## Scene 12: Bad News from Home

_Notes: Aria is subdued, and the player can sense something is wrong. Aria reveals that her sister is ill, and she's feeling the distance from home. The player can offer support and encouragement._
### `12_AriaInquiry`
_Aria appears on the intercom, her usual vibrancy dimmed, her tone subdued._

`[12_AriaInquiry01]`
Hey, Cap... Sorry, I'm a bit out of sorts today. What's up?

### `12_PlayerResponseConcerned`

`[12_PlayerResponseConcerned01]`
You don’t seem yourself. Anything you want to share?

### `12_PlayerResponseGentleProbing`

`[12_PlayerResponseGentleProbing01]`
You're usually more animated, Aria. Is something troubling you?

### `12_PlayerResponseRespectfulDistance`

`[12_PlayerResponseRespectfulDistance01]`
If you're not up for talking, that's okay. We can keep it work-related if you prefer.

### `12_PlayerResponseDirect`

`[12_PlayerResponseDirect01]`
You look like something's weighing on you. If you want to talk, I'm here.

### `12_AriaResponseToConcerned`
_She hesitates, offering a strained smile._

`[12_AriaResponseToConcerned01]`
Just family things, you know? It's tough being so far away sometimes.

### `12_AriaResponseToGentleProbing`
_Aria lets out a soft sigh._

`[12_AriaResponseToGentleProbing01]`
It's hard to hide anything from you, isn't it? Just some news from back home. Makes you think about life choices.

### `12_AriaResponseToRespectfulDistance`
_Gratefully nodding_

`[12_AriaResponseToRespectfulDistance01]`
Thanks for understanding. Let's just focus on work today. Helps to keep the mind occupied.

### `12_AriaResponseToDirect`
_Pausing briefly_

`[12_AriaResponseToDirect01]`
I appreciate your straightforwardness. It's my little sister; shes ill. And I'm here, worlds away.

### `12_PlayerFollowupResponseSympathetic`

`[12_PlayerFollowupResponseSympathetic01]`
It's tough, being so far. If talking about it helps, I'm here to listen.

### `12_PlayerFollowupResponseInquisitive`

`[12_PlayerFollowupResponseInquisitive01]`
Do you feel like being here, pursuing your dreams, is worth the distance from family?

### `12_PlayerFollowupResponseSupportive`

`[12_PlayerFollowupResponseSupportive01]`
Focus on what you can control, Aria. You're doing important work here.

### `12_PlayerFollowupResponseNonIntrusive`

`[12_PlayerFollowupResponseNonIntrusive01]`
We don’t have to talk about it more if you don’t want to. Just know, you’re not alone.

### `12_PlayerResponseEmpathy`

`[12_PlayerResponseEmpathy01]`
It's never easy to be away from family, especially in times like these. If you need to talk or just take a break, I'm here.

### `12_PlayerResponsePracticalSupport`

`[12_PlayerResponsePracticalSupport01]`
That's tough to hear. Are there ways we can help from here? Maybe there's something we can do, even from afar.

### `12_PlayerResponseSharedExperience`

`[12_PlayerResponseSharedExperience01]`
I've been there, Aria. Distance can make these things harder. Just remember, she knows you're thinking of her.

### `12_PlayerResponseEncouragingOptimism`

`[12_PlayerResponseEncouragingOptimism01]`
I'm sorry about your sister. Let's hold onto hope, though. Sometimes, good news can travel just as fast as the bad.

### `12_PlayerResponseOfferSpace`

`[12_PlayerResponseOfferSpace01]`
If you need some time to process this or make a call, take all the time you need. Work can wait.

### `12_AriaResponseToEmpathy`
_Aria's eyes reflect gratitude._

`[12_AriaResponseToEmpathy01]`
Thanks. It means a lot just knowing you're here to listen. Makes the distance feel a little less vast.

### `12_AriaResponseToPracticalSupport`
_She considers this._

`[12_AriaResponseToPracticalSupport01]`
That's a kind thought. Maybe there's something we can do from here. I'll think about it. Thank you.

### `12_AriaResponseToSharedExperience`
_You can see the comfort in her expression._

`[12_AriaResponseToSharedExperience01]`
It helps to know someone understands. Just having people around who get it... it's a big deal.

### `12_AriaResponseToEncouragingOptimism`
_Her smile is small but genuine._

`[12_AriaResponseToEncouragingOptimism01]`
Optimism, right? I need a bit of that right now. Thanks for the reminder to stay hopeful.

### `12_AriaResponseToOfferSpace`
_Relief washes over her._

`[12_AriaResponseToOfferSpace01]`
I might take you up on that. Just a little time to gather my thoughts could help. Thanks, Cap.

### `12_AriaFollowupResponseToSympathetic`
_Her eyes soften._

`[12_AriaFollowupResponseToSympathetic01]`
Thanks, it means a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, being here while my family's back there.

### `12_AriaFollowupResponseToInquisitive`
_She looks thoughtful._

`[12_AriaFollowupResponseToInquisitive01]`
That's the question, isn't it? I believe in what I'm doing here, but at moments like this, I question the cost.

### `12_AriaFollowupResponseToSupportive`
_A nod of acknowledgement._

`[12_AriaFollowupResponseToSupportive01]`
You're right. I chose this path for a reason. Just need to remember why on days like this.

### `12_AriaFollowupResponseToNonIntrusive`
_There's a hint of relief in her voice._

`[12_AriaFollowupResponseToNonIntrusive01]`
I appreciate that, really. Sometimes just knowing someone's there to listen is enough.

## Scene 13: Hidden Passions - Humble Revelations

_Notes: Aria reveals her hobbies and the joy of learning for its own sake._
### `13_PlayerInquiry`

`[13_PlayerInquiry01]`
What's your downtime look like, Aria? Any unique hobbies outside of your ship work?

### `13_AriaResponse`

`[13_AriaResponse01]`
I've taken up cooking. I'm no chef, mind you. Half the time, it's more of an experiment than a meal. But there's something satisfying about creating with your hands, even if it's just a quirky sandwich.
And I dabble in amateur astronomy. I’m not particularly great at it – I can barely tell the constellations apart! But gazing at the stars, not as a designer but just as myself, it's kind of liberating.

### `13_PlayerResponseEncouraging`

`[13_PlayerResponseEncouraging01]`
Exploring new territories, even in the kitchen or the night sky. That's exciting, even if it's not about perfection.

### `13_PlayerResponseLightTease`

`[13_PlayerResponseLightTease01]`
Chef Aria and the star-gazer who can't find Orion? Sounds like you're enjoying the learning curve.

### `13_PlayerResponseUnderstanding`

`[13_PlayerResponseUnderstanding01]`
Those sound like great ways to unwind. It's not always about being the best, but enjoying the process.

### `13_PlayerResponseReflective`

`[13_PlayerResponseReflective01]`
It’s good to hear you doing things just for the joy of it, not just for the end result. That’s important.

### `13_AriaResponseToEncouraging`
_Aria chuckles, a touch of self-deprecation in her tone._

`[13_AriaResponseToEncouraging01]`
Exciting and a little humbling! But you're right, it's not about perfection. It's about the joy of trying, of creating.

### `13_AriaResponseToLightTease`
_Her laughter is genuine, tinged with a hint of embarrassment._

`[13_AriaResponseToLightTease01]`
Yeah, I'm embracing the 'amateur' in both! There's freedom in just being a novice, a learner. It's a nice change of pace.

### `13_AriaResponseToUnderstanding`
_She nods appreciatively, a reflective look in her eyes._

`[13_AriaResponseToUnderstanding01]`
Exactly. For so long, I've been driven by the need to excel. It's refreshing to do something just for the sheer enjoyment, even if I'm not the best at it.

### `13_AriaResponseToReflective`
_There's a moment of vulnerability in her expression._

`[13_AriaResponseToReflective01]`
You've hit the nail on the head. I'm used to valuing time for productivity. Learning to value it just for the experience – that's new for me.

## Scene 14: Legacy and Impact

### `14_PlayerInquiry`

`[14_PlayerInquiry01]`
You're pouring so much into these ship designs, Aria. What kind of legacy are you hoping to build?

### `14_AriaResponse`
_Aria's voice carries a mix of passion and a hint of defensiveness._

`[14_AriaResponse01]`
Legacy? I'm here to revolutionize space travel. To be a name that changed the industry, not just a footnote in its history.
But it's not just about making a name. It's about today's work impacting tomorrow. If my ships can inspire or protect, then I've done my job.

### `14_PlayerResponseSupport`

`[14_PlayerResponseSupport01]`
Your determination is admirable. You're not just building ships; you're building the future. That's a legacy in itself.

### `14_PlayerResponseThoughtful`

`[14_PlayerResponseThoughtful01]`
It's good to aim high, but remember, the greatest legacies are often the unexpected impacts, the ripples we create.

### `14_PlayerResponseConcern`

`[14_PlayerResponseConcern01]`
It's great to have goals, Aria, but don't get lost chasing them. Sometimes the best legacy is a life well-lived, not just well-worked.

### `14_PlayerResponseChallenging`

`[14_PlayerResponseChallenging01]`
A legacy, huh? Is this about making a mark, or is there something deeper you're searching for in your work?

### `14_AriaResponseToSupport`
_She nods, her eyes bright._

`[14_AriaResponseToSupport01]`
Thanks, that's the plan. To push the boundaries, to leave something lasting and meaningful.

### `14_AriaResponseToThoughtful`
_Her gaze drifts, contemplative._

`[14_AriaResponseToThoughtful01]`
I never thought of it that way. Maybe the legacy isn't just the ships, but the journeys they enable, the stories they become part of.

### `14_AriaResponseToConcern`
_A moment of genuine reflection crosses her face._

`[14_AriaResponseToConcern01]`
You're right; it's easy to get caught up. I've been so focused on the destination, I might be missing the journey.

### `14_AriaResponseToChallenging`
_Aria's response is tinged with defensiveness, her expression firm._

`[14_AriaResponseToChallenging01]`
Look, I know what I'm doing. This isn't just about making my mark. It's about fulfilling a vision, a purpose. Sure, I'm driven, but who isn't in this field? I'm here to make a difference, and that's exactly what I plan to do.

## Scene 15: Sacrifices

_Notes: This scene delves into the complex nature of Aria's career-driven life, challenging her to confront the personal costs and momentarily revealing the vulnerability behind her confident facade._
### `15_PlayerInquiry`

`[15_PlayerInquiry01]`
You’ve climbed high in your field, Aria. But I have to wonder, what personal costs came with that ascent?

### `15_AriaResponse`
_There's an edge to her voice. _

`[15_AriaResponse01]`
Sacrifice is part of the game. I’ve let go of the conventional, sure. But what I’m doing here... it’s worth more than any traditional path.
I’ve traded simplicity for complexity, and I don't regret it. I’m not one for stillness; I need the rush of creation, of discovery.

### `15_PlayerResponseUnderstanding`

`[15_PlayerResponseUnderstanding01]`
Your focus and dedication are truly remarkable. Just be careful not to lose yourself completely in the pursuit.

### `15_PlayerResponseInquisitive`

`[15_PlayerResponseInquisitive01]`
But doesn't that ever weigh on you? The things you've had to leave behind in chasing this dream?

### `15_PlayerResponseSupportive`

`[15_PlayerResponseSupportive01]`
It's clear you're exactly where you're meant to be, Aria. Your work speaks volumes about your passion and commitment.

### `15_PlayerResponseIntimate`

`[15_PlayerResponseIntimate01]`
Ever think about what a different Aria, one with a quieter life, might be like? Sometimes the roads not taken are worth a thought too.

### `15_AriaResponseToUnderstanding`
_Aria nods, her confidence intact._

`[15_AriaResponseToUnderstanding01]`
I'm well aware of what I've chosen. This is my world, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

### `15_AriaResponseToInquisitive`
_She responds briskly._

`[15_AriaResponseToInquisitive01]`
Sure, it weighs on me. But regret is a distraction. I’m here to push boundaries, not dwell on what-ifs.

### `15_AriaResponseToSupportive`
_Her expression brightens, reaffirming her path._

`[15_AriaResponseToSupportive01]`
Thank you. I’ve never been one for the sidelines. I'm here to make waves, to make a difference.

### `15_AriaResponseToIntimate`
_Caught off guard, her usual composure falters._

`[15_AriaResponseToIntimate01]`
A quieter life... I don't often let myself think about that. Maybe... maybe I should, even if just for a moment.

## Scene 16: Aria Reflects on Family and Regrets

_Notes: This emotionally complex scene starts with Aria's rare moment of vulnerability about her family, which she either opens up more about or distances herself from, depending on the player's approach._
### `16_PlayerInquiry`

`[16_PlayerInquiry01]`
Your dedication to your career is clear, Aria. But how has this journey affected your ties with family?

### `16_AriaResponse`
_Aria's facade momentarily slips, revealing a raw, emotional undercurrent._

`[16_AriaResponse01]`
It's... it's been hard. I've been so wrapped up in my work, I've let those connections fade. It's one of those things you don't notice until it hits you.
I left for the stars so young, so eager. I told myself it was for the greater good, but... I missed so much back home. It's a silence that's grown too loud to ignore.

### `16_PlayerResponseCompassionate`

`[16_PlayerResponseCompassionate01]`
It's a tough balance to strike. Maybe it's not too late to start bridging that gap, to reconnect.

### `16_PlayerResponsePractical`

`[16_PlayerResponsePractical01]`
Your achievements are incredible, but sometimes, reconnecting with family can bring a different sense of accomplishment.

### `16_PlayerResponseProbing`

`[16_PlayerResponseProbing01]`
Is that silence something you're thinking of addressing? It might bring you a different kind of peace.

### `16_PlayerResponseDismissive`

`[16_PlayerResponseDismissive01]`
Well, sacrifices are part of the job, right? You can’t reach the stars without leaving something behind.

### `16_AriaResponseToCompassionate`
_The vulnerability in Aria’s voice is palpable, her usual confidence replaced by a rare sense of fear._

`[16_AriaResponseToCompassionate01]`
You might be right, but... it terrifies me. The thought of reaching out after all this time, facing them... it feels like standing on the edge of a black hole. I don't know if I'm ready to confront that darkness yet.

### `16_AriaResponseToPractical`
_There's a shift in her demeanor, a mix of acceptance and hesitation._

`[16_AriaResponseToPractical01]`
You have a point. My work has always been my focus, but... maybe there's room for both in my life.

### `16_AriaResponseToProbing`
_A brief flicker of contemplation crosses her face, then she retreats slightly._

`[16_AriaResponseToProbing01]`
It's something I'm wrestling with. Maybe addressing it will bring peace, but... let's just say I'm not there yet.

### `16_AriaResponseToDismissive`
_Her defenses snap back up, the vulnerability gone._

`[16_AriaResponseToDismissive01]`
Exactly. You get it. Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, right? I've made my choice, for better or worse.

## Scene 17: Intercom

### `17_PlayerInquiry`

`[17_PlayerInquiry01]`
Why do we have to use the intercom to communicate?

### `17_AriaResponse`

`[17_AriaResponse01]`
Ah, well, the workshop's in full reno mode. Picture this: a rogue drone, a misplaced laser cutter, and poof—suddenly you're embracing the minimalist aesthetic. Who knew drones were such critics of industrial design?
Which means I'm marooned in my apartment, turning ship schematics and not much else. I've memorized every crack in the ceiling and named all my plant life. They're terrible conversationalists, by the way.
Working remote's the new rage, they say. It's all fun and games until you realize your fridge doesn't stock itself and your cat's been the boss all along. But hey, at least the commute's a breeze!
Anyway, enough about my four-wall odyssey. Let's get back to spaceships and stars—because if I stare at this paint dry any longer, I might just start talking back to it.

## Scene 18: Abandon Contract

### `18_PlayerInquiry`

`[18_PlayerInquiry01]`
I'm having trouble with this contract. Can we switch it up?

### `18_AriaResponse`

`[18_AriaResponse01]`
No problem, Cap! Not every ship is a perfect match. I'll find this one a new captain.
I'm updating the mission board right now. Let's find you a project that's more your speed.
Sometimes a detour is part of the journey. Let's get you on a path that feels right.
Keep your chin up. Space is vast, and there's always something else out there for you.
