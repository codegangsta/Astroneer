# Dialogue: Aria Collins

_Read Aria's Bio (Attached) for a full background and character bio._

High-level checklist:

- [ ] Read through Aria's bio and through all of the scenes, notes and lines before recording
- [ ] Record all the dialogue, The player dialogue does not need to be recorded, it is only there for reference
- [ ] You are free to make any changes to the dialogue to make it sound better for a read, please just note down which dialogues have changed so I can modify the voice lines/subtitles in game
- [ ] No post-processing needed, just make sure levels are good.
- [ ] Split, export and rename each line according to the label above it, in a wav file format. (Example AriaGreet01.wav, AriaGreet02.wav)
- [ ] Send the files to jeremy and he will add them to the game

## Misc Scenes: RAW

Certainly! I'll provide a detailed dialogue scenario with four varied player responses and Aria's reply to each.

[Hidden Fears]
Aria: "In all the galaxy's vastness, Cap, I sometimes worry... What if my designs never take flight? What if they're destined to remain just... sketches?"

[Player Response Options]
[Player Reassuring]

"Your talent's as boundless as the cosmos, Aria. Those designs will soar, I'm sure of it."
[Player Pragmatic]
"It's a tough industry, but good designs stand out. Keep at it, and they'll find their way into the stars."
[Player Ambitious]
"Then we'll make them take flight together. No sketch is too ambitious when you've got the right team."
[Player Blunt]
"You can't let fear hold you back. In space, hesitation isn't just a setback, it's a liability."
[Aria's Response to Player Reassuring]
Aria: "I appreciate that, Cap. Your confidence in me... it's like a supernova boost to my spirit."

[Aria's Response to Player Pragmatic]
Aria: "That's just the kind of grounded advice I need sometimes. You've got a way of simplifying the stars, you know?"

[Aria's Response to Player Ambitious]
Aria: "With you? I believe it. We're like binary stars, stronger together. Let's turn those sketches into legends."

[Aria's Response to Player Blunt]
Aria: "Sharp words, but there's truth there. Space doesn't coddle dreamers. I'll remember that next time I hesitate."

This approach allows Aria to react differently to the player's attitude and input, showcasing her adaptability and emotional range. It also allows the player to influence the tone of their relationship and Aria's development within the game.
