# Dialogue: Aria Collins

_Read Aria's Bio (Attached) for a full background and character bio._

High-level checklist:

- [ ] Read through Aria's bio and through all of the scenes, notes and lines before recording
- [ ] Record all the dialogue, The player dialogue does not need to be recorded, it is only there for reference
- [ ] You are free to make any changes to the dialogue to make it sound better for a read, please just note down which dialogues have changed so I can modify the voice lines/subtitles in game
- [ ] No post-processing needed, just make sure levels are good.
- [ ] Split, export and rename each line according to the label above it, in a wav file format. (Example AriaGreet01.wav, AriaGreet02.wav)
- [ ] Send the files to jeremy and he will add them to the game
