## Scene 1: Aria is Introduced the player

TODO

## Scene 2a: Aria Greets the player

_Context: The player has just accepted a mission from the mission board and has walked over to the Atlas Astronautics intercom to speak with Aria. Upon pushing the "Call button", Aria responds from the intercom._

_Note: This response is typically played after the introductory quest, so Aria has already been introduced to the player._

[AriaGreet01]
"Ah, my favorite cosmic collaborator! What challenge are we tackling with our combined genius today?"

[AriaGreet02]
"Look who's traversed the stars to grace us with their presence! What interstellar intrigue are we unraveling today?"

[AriaGreet03]
"Salutations! Just in time for a fresh batch of cosmic conundrums. Ready to dive in?"

[AriaGreet04]
"Welcome! Our design deck awaits your esteemed input. Shall we make some magic?"

[AriaGreet05]
"Ah, the maestro of the schematics! What masterpiece shall we conjure up today?"

[AriaGreet06]
"Touchdown! Ready for a brainstorm, or is it a brain hurricane with you? Either way, it'll be epic."

[AriaGreet07]
"Captain of innovation at the helm! What's today's mission in the great blueprint yonder?"

[AriaGreet08]
"Hey there! Whether it's contracts or constellations, I'm ready if you are. What's first on the agenda?"

[AriaGreet09]
"Star traveler and design maverick! I've got ideas brewing that are hotter than a supernova. Care to taste?"

[AriaGreet10]
"Greetings! Let's blend your vision with my tech for another day of legendary ship crafting, shall we?"

[AriaGreet11]
"Welcome back to the forge of the future. Ready to hammer out some new legends?"

[AriaGreet12]
"Ah, the prodigal shipwright returns! The galaxy's canvas awaits your next stroke of brilliance."

[AriaGreet13]
"Step right up to the cosmic carousel! What fantastical ride shall we craft today?"

[AriaGreet14]
"Good to see you! The stars have aligned for some creativity. Let's not keep them waiting."

[AriaGreet15]
"Welcome, spacefarer! Got your gear? Good. I've got plans and a penchant for the extraordinary."

[AriaGreet16]
"Back for more galactic artistry? Excellent. Our design studio is a nebula of potential today."

## Scene 2b: Aria Greets the player (funny/bored)

_Context: Identical to the previous scene, but shows off even more of Aria's quirky side. Aria is suffering from boredom becuase Atlas Astronautics is currently under construction, keeping her away from the ship bays where she wants to be, and sequestered to her tiny New Atlantis apartment, where it's often just her and her radio receiver. She's obviously going a bit stir crazy._

[AriaGreetFunny01]
"Hello, you've reached Aria, your friendly neighborhood shipwright. If you hear snoring, just yell into the mic—I'm probably under a pile of blueprints dreaming of engines."

[AriaGreetFunny02]
"If you're hearing this, congrats! You've successfully hailed the most star-struck ship designer between here and Andromeda. Now, let's talk ships before I start talking to the furniture."

[AriaGreetFunny03]
"Aria’s interstellar answering service, star-date today! Press 1 for ship designs, press 2 for cosmic banter, or stay on the line to help me escape the black hole of boredom."

[AriaGreetFunny04]
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening]! Aria’s voice beaming to you from the depths of my design den—where the coffee's strong and the ideas are stronger. What's the buzz?"

[AriaGreetFunny05]
"You’ve reached Aria Collins: half-ship designer, half-space DJ. Spin that dial for tunes, or let's design ships that'll make the Kessel Run in record time."

[AriaGreetFunny06]
"Psst, it’s Aria. Quick, before my indoor plant becomes my new design assistant, tell me you've got something exciting for us to work on!"

[AriaGreetFunny07]
"Do you read me? This is Aria broadcasting live from the land of schematics and caffeine! Ready to transmit some electrifying ideas?"

[AriaGreetFunny08]
"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Nope, it's just me, Aria, stuck in my apartment waiting for your call. So, what spaceship are we going to conquer the universe with today?"

[AriaGreetFunny09]
"Hey, space cadet! I've resorted to making paper airplanes, so let's design something a bit more advanced, shall we?"

[AriaGreetFunny10]
"Aria here, reporting from my living room command center, featuring a couch that doubles as a makeshift cockpit. What's our flight plan for today?"

[AriaGreetFunny11]
"Greetings, Earthling! This is your favorite ship designer, Aria, speaking to you from the great beyond... of my apartment. Got any galactic news?"

[AriaGreetFunny12]
"Incoming transmission from Aria: I've officially named all my appliances after celestial bodies. So, what's our mission before I start talking to them about thruster mechanics?"

[AriaGreetFunny13]
"Knock knock. Who's there? Aria, stuck on the comms channel, waiting to unleash some cosmic creativity. Beam us up some fun, will you?"

[AriaGreetFunny14]
"Cap, this is Aria, your intergalactic pen pal. I've just about rearranged my furniture into a spaceship. How about we design the real deal instead?"

[AriaGreetFunny15]
"You’ve reached the one-woman spacecraft think tank. I’ve been floating in a sea of solitude here, so your voice is a welcome docking request!"

## Scene 3: Player Accepts Contract

_Context: The player has accepted a mission from the mission board, and has walked over to the Atlas Astronautics intercom to speak with Aria. Aria greets the player, then the player chooses to ask about the contract they've just accepted. Based on the type of Ship contract, a randomly generated response from Aria will be chosen. The intent is to have enough dialog and variety that each mission feels fresh and new_

### Player Dialogue

[PlayerAcceptContract01]
“Any ships in need of a designer’s hand today?"

[PlayerAcceptContract02]
"Is there a new vessel for me to take under my wing?"

[PlayerAcceptContract03]
"Got a ship that needs some love?"

[PlayerAcceptContract04]
"I'm here for that contract—what's the assignment?"

[PlayerAcceptContract05]
"What's the latest ship on the roster?"

[PlayerAcceptContract06]
"Ready for a new project; what have you got?"

[PlayerAcceptContract07]
"Looking for a ship that could use a tune-up?"

[PlayerAcceptContract08]
"Heard about a ship needing a fix, is it mine to take?"

[PlayerAcceptContract09]
"What's the word on that new contract?"

### Aria's Response: Generic

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric01]
"Here she is, Cap. She's a canvas that's seen a few cosmic storms, but I know you'll turn her into a masterpiece."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric02]
"This ship's got a history, and with your touch, I bet she'll have quite the future."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric03]
"All yours. She might not look like much now, but I've seen your work. She's in good hands."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric04]
"Got a new project for you. She’s a bit of a relic, but there's plenty of life in her yet."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric05]
"This beauty's had her glory days—time to bring 'em back, don't you think?"

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric06]
"Take good care of her. I'm expecting this old ship to break some new ground once you're done."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric07]
"She's ready for your hangar. I’m eager to see this transformation—make her shine."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric08]
"Remember, it's not just about the specs. Give her some character, something that'll turn heads in the hangar."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric09]
"This contract's a big one. No pressure, but I'm pretty sure you're going to knock it out of the park."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric10]
"She’s served us well, and now it's time for a new chapter. I'm looking forward to your revisions."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric11]
"A bit of a fixer-upper, sure, but give her the time she deserves, and she'll fly true."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric12]
"I've done my part, now it's all you. She might be old, but there's still speed in those engines."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric13]
"She's in your capable hands now. Just remember, every great ship has a bit of its designer's soul in it."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric14]
"This ship's seen the edges of the galaxy, and now with your help, she'll see them once more. Excited to see where you take her, Cap."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric15]
"It's not every day you get to refurbish a classic. Can't wait to see her after you work your magic."

### Aria's Response: Fighter Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractFighter01]
"That I do. Got a ship here with more tales of valor than a space opera. Ready to pen its next epic chapter?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter02]
"Right on the mark. There's a craft in the hangar that's got 'daredevil' written all over it. Just needs a co-author—preferably one who's good with a wrench."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter03]
"Absolutely, Cap. There's a vessel lined up that's as eager for adventure as a comet is for orbit. Shall we give it a plot twist?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter04]
"Indeed, there's a plucky ship awaiting your touch. It's got a spirit for the skirmish and a body that... well, that's where you come in."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter05]
"You heard correct. Got a ship that's been through the asteroid belt and back. Fancy turning its scars into stars?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter06]
"Yes, there's a speedster craving your attention. She's swift, but under your command? I bet she could outrun a shooting star."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter07]
"The intel's spot-on. A little bird—or should I say satellite—told me you've got a soft spot for the spirited types."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter08]
"News does fly faster than light. There's a craft here that's part dare, part dash, and entirely ready for an overhaul."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter09]
"Heard right, Cap. There's a vessel here that's been resting too long in the hangar shadows. Time to let it chase the sunlight, don't you think?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter10]
"Tuning into the grapevine, I see. Well, the rumors are true. There's a ship that's just yearning for a bit of that tactical genius."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter11]
"Sharp ears! Got a ship here that's all heart and ambition. It's got the guts; it just needs a bit of your glory."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter12]
"Good, Cap. There’s a vessel here with a few stories etched on its hull, waiting for a fresh chapter."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter13]
"You're right on target. There's a craft here dreaming of nebula races. How about we wake it up to reality?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter14]
"Spot on. Docked in bay nine is a ship that’s been whispering for some TLC. It's practically drafting love letters to your toolkit."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter15]
"Bullseye, Cap. The ship you're about to meet has a need for speed and a penchant for stealth. Ready to be its partner in crime?"

### Aria's Response: Explorer Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer01]
"That I do. There's an explorer out there with a thirst for the unknown. Fancy charting some unexplored territories?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer02]
"You're bang on. I’ve got a vessel that’s seen more stars than a galactic map. She’s ready for a designer with a curious heart."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer03]
"Indeed, Cap. There's a research craft that’s been to the edge of the void and back—could use a visionary to expand its horizons."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer04]
"Absolutely. There's a ship here that's been whispering about distant galaxies. I think it's time someone listened."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer05]
"Right you are. There's an explorer in the hangar that's just brimming with potential. How about you unlock its secrets?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer06]
"You heard right. This vessel's got 'explorer' in its DNA, but it's looking for the right crew to decode it."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer07]
"You've got the right intel. This ship's an archive of adventure—just needs a new story. Think you're up to write it?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer08]
"Good news does indeed travel at warp speed. Got a research ship that's eager for a captain with a penchant for discovery."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer09]
"Spot on, Cap. There's a vessel that's ready to dive into the great cosmic library. Fancy being its librarian?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer10]
"You're in tune with the cosmic currents, I see. I’ve got a ship that's aching to unravel the mysteries of the universe."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer11]
"Sharp ears! This ship's ready to scan the frontiers—and with your help, who knows what secrets we'll uncover?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer12]
"Your sources serve you well. There's an explorer here that's been gathering dust when it should be gathering data."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer13]
"Indeed, there's a craft with a hull full of questions. I'm thinking you've got the answers."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer14]
"Precisely. This ship's destiny is to pioneer the stars. Help it fulfill that destiny, will you?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer15]
"Spot on, Cap. There's a research vessel in the bay that's been dreaming of nebulas and quasars. Ready to make those dreams a reality?"

### Aria's Response: Hauler Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractHauler01]
"Got something special for you, Cap. There's a freighter that’s more than ready to flex its cargo muscles under your command."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler02]
"Indeed, I've got a hauler here with enough storage space to make a black hole jealous. Care to give it a spin?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler03]
"Absolutely, Cap. There's a vessel that's been hauling dreams. Time to upgrade it to haul stars, perhaps?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler04]
"You've got it. This freighter's looking to expand its horizons—maybe carry more than just cargo, if you catch my drift."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler05]
"That's right. There’s a hauler in the bay that's good at keeping secrets—like hidden compartments. Interested in a little show and tell?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler06]
"You heard correct. This big beauty's got a cargo hold that's crying out for adventure. Think you can chart its course?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler07]
"You're spot on. There's a freighter that’s just yearning for someone who can handle her... extensive assets."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler08]
"Good intel, Cap. I’ve got a hauler that could use a designers’s gaze. It's all loaded up with potential—and maybe some contraband charm."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler09]
"Heard right, Cap. There's a freighter here that's sturdy as an old space tavern tale. Ready to add a few chapters?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler10]
"You're in tune with the shipping lanes, I see. There's a hauler here that's robust, reliable, and just a bit rusty around the thrusters."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler11]
"Spot on. This vessel’s ready to carry the weight of worlds. Well, their goods, at least. Fancy being the one at the helm?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler12]
"Precisely. There's a freighter docked that's looking to up its game from asteroid hopping to planet skipping."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler13]
"Indeed, there's a hauler that's been around the block. Ready to turn it into the pride of the trade routes?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler14]
"That I do. There's a vessel in the bay that’s perfect for a captain with a keen eye for commerce and cargo."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler15]
"Right on the mark. There's a freighter in the hangar that could use a bit of your entrepreneurial spirit. Shall we negotiate terms?"

### Aria's Response: Interceptor Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor01]
"Cap, there's a swift number in the bay that's all about the chase. Think you can catch her potential?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor02]
"You're just in time. Got an interceptor here that's faster than a comet's tail. Ready to make it even swifter?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor03]
"Indeed, there's a craft that's built for the rush. It's got speed to spare, but it's waiting for your go-ahead."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor04]
"Absolutely, Cap. There's a vessel that's been outrunning radio waves. Fancy tuning it to outpace light?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor05]
"Got a racer's dream on deck. It's sleek, it's fast, and with your help, it could be the first through the finish line of a wormhole."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor06]
"That's right. There’s an interceptor in the hangar that's almost too hot to touch. Think you can handle the heat?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor07]
"Spot on. This craft is more needle than ship, ready to thread through the cosmos at breakneck speed."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor08]
"You heard correct. This interceptor's just a few tweaks away from breaking the sound barrier—on silent mode."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor09]
"Good intel, Cap. There's a speedster that's been dying to stretch its wings. Ready to give it the runway?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor10]
"Heard right. There's a vessel here with engines that hum a tune of pure velocity. Care to conduct the symphony?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor11]
"Your sources are good, Cap. There's an interceptor here that's quick on the draw but could use a faster holster."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor12]
"Indeed, I've got a craft that whispers through space-time. It's almost as stealthy as it is quick. Almost."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor13]
"Precisely. This interceptor’s sleek lines hide a beast under the hood. Ready to unleash it?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor14]
"Spot on, Cap. There’s a ship in the bay that’s begging to break free from the laws of physics. Fancy giving it a lesson in rebellion?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor15]
"Right on the mark. Docked in bay seven is a vessel that’s practically vibrating with untapped speed. Let's turn that tremble into a tremor."

### Aria's Response: Luxury Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury01]
"Cap, I've got a floating palace that's longing for a touch of your grandeur. Ready to make it fit for a sovereign of the stars?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury02]
"You've come at the right time. There's a luxury liner here with interiors that are crying out for a revamp. How about it?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury03]
"Indeed, there’s a vessel in the hangar that's more boutique hotel than ship. Fancy adding a few stars to its rating?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury04]
"Absolutely, Cap. I’ve got a ship that's designed for the high life—just needs an astroneer with your eye for elegance."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury05]
"That's right. There's a luxury craft here with the potential to turn heads from here to the edge of the galaxy. Interested in some high-class engineering?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury06]
"Spot on. This yacht whispers opulence, but I think you could make it sing. Ready to compose a symphony of splendor?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury07]
"You heard correct. There's a vessel that's all about the finer things in life—like faster-than-light travel in a velvet glove."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury08]
"Good news travels in style, it seems. There's a luxury ship here that's just a gemstone's throw away from perfection. Care to be its jeweler?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury09]
"Heard right, Cap. There's a cruiser in the hangar that's as lavish as they come—but with room for your signature flourish."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury10]
"You're in tune with the high life, I see. I’ve got a ship that's a marvel of comfort, just waiting for that extra touch of class."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury11]
"Sharp ears! This luxury liner's got all the amenities, but it could use a dash of your adventurous spirit."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury12]
"Your sources serve you well. There's a pleasure craft here that's been sunbathing in the dock too long. Ready to take her out?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury13]
"Indeed, there's a ship designed for the elite, but I think you could make it a legend of luxury."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury14]
"Precisely. This vessel’s a crown jewel in need of a little polish. Ready to make it shine, Cap?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury15]
"Right on the mark. There's an opulent behemoth in the bay that’s dying to break its gilded chains. Shall we?"

## Scene 3: Player Accepts Contract

_Context: The player has finished building the ship according to the contract specs, and is ready to turn it in to Aria._

### Player Dialogue

[PlayerCompleteContract01]
"Design's in. Does it capture what you were looking for?"

[PlayerCompleteContract02]
"Finished with the ship. How does it measure up to our standards?"

[PlayerCompleteContract03]
"Completed the contract. What's your take on the final product?"

[PlayerCompleteContract04]
"Just submitted my design. Will it pass the Aria test?"

[PlayerCompleteContract05]
"Redesign's done. Does it have the Aria stamp of approval?"

[PlayerCompleteContract06]
"Contract's done. I'm eager to hear your thoughts."

[PlayerCompleteContract07]
"Wrapped up the ship. It should meet the mark."

[PlayerCompleteContract08]
"Finished the upgrade. It's ready for your review."

[PlayerCompleteContract09]
"The ship's reimagined, per your vision."

[PlayerCompleteContract10]
"Ship redesign submitted. It's a fresh take on an old classic."

### Aria's Response: Generic

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric01]
"Cap, you've given this vessel a new heartbeat. It's almost as if it's breathing the cosmos."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric02]
"This redesign... it's like you took the ship's dreams and turned them into a reality. Simply stunning."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric03]
"You've not just changed the ship; you've transformed the way it'll carve its path through the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric04]
"I always say a ship has personality, but this? You've given it a soul, and a rather charismatic one at that."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric05]
"The craftsmanship here is sublime. You've taken ship design from a profession to an art form."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric06]
"You've made turning heads into an interstellar sport with this design. Bravo, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric07]
"I've seen ships with flair, but this is something else. It's like the universe tailor-made it."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric08]
"This ship used to whisper through the void. Now, it sings. And what a beautiful song it's chosen."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric09]
"You've managed to capture the essence of flight in this design. It's poetry in motion, even while docked."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric10]
"Every once in a while, a ship comes along that reminds us why we took to the stars. This is that ship."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric11]
"Cap, this ship's not just ready to face the galaxy; it's ready to become its legend."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric12]
"The lines, the form, the exquisite detail... you've not just redesigned a ship; you've reimagined what it means to travel the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric13]
"There's a fine line between a ship and a symphony. You, my friend, have composed a masterpiece."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric14]
"This vessel now has the kind of allure that could make a black hole think twice about swallowing it up."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric15]
"It's one thing to make a ship functional, another to make it beautiful, but you've done both—with style to spare."

### Aria's Response: Fighter Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractFighter01]
"Cap, you’ve turned this fighter into a celestial falcon. Those wings aren't just for show, huh?"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter02]
"Wow, it's like you gave it claws and a cloaking device. This fighter's ready to dance with the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter03]
"Is it just me, or did you somehow make the vacuum of space afraid of this ship? That's some fierce redesign."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter04]
"You've taken 'sleek' to new levels. This baby could slip through a meteor shower unscathed."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter05]
"I would say 'good job,' but that wouldn't cover it. You've crafted a star predator here."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter06]
"Impressive. You've managed to make speed and agility shake hands. That's one harmonious fighter."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter07]
"I've seen shooting stars bulkier than this. You've really trimmed the fat and boosted the muscle."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter08]
"The engines purr like a kitten, but we both know this thing roars like a tiger in the black."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter09]
"By the stars, you've turned a blunt instrument into a scalpel. Precision and power in one package—beautiful."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter10]
"You've given this fighter a sting that would make a wasp jealous. I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter11]
"I always say a ship has to have spirit, and you've given this one a soul. A fast, furious soul, but a soul nonetheless."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter12]
"The thrusters! Did you do something with the thrusters? Because it feels like it's ready to jump out of its own hull."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter13]
"This fighter looks like it could cut through space-time. Did you add a few extra dimensions to it or what?"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter14]
"I've heard of putting a tiger in your tank, but you put one in the whole ship! It's ready to pounce on any challenge."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter15]
"That’s not just a redesign, it's a reimagining. You've not only raised the bar, you've shot it into orbit!"

### Aria's Response: Explorer Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer01]
"Cap, this isn't just an explorer—it's a cosmic cartographer now. The stars are going to line up for a peek inside!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer02]
"I always knew this hull had secrets, but you've turned it into a library of the universe. Well done!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer03]
"The sensors on this vessel used to whisper, now they sing symphonies about distant galaxies. You've outdone yourself."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer04]
"You've turned a simple explorer into a pioneer's dream. It's like a compass pointing straight to the heart of adventure."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer05]
"With this redesign, I'm half expecting it to unfold into a space station. You've packed in everything but the kitchen sink—wait, is that a kitchen sink?"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer06]
"You've not just crossed the 'T's and dotted the 'I's, you rewrote the whole alphabet. This research vessel is a thesis in space engineering."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer07]
"The labs were cramped and the living quarters were... quaint. Now? It's a five-star hotel with a science wing. Impressive."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer08]
"You took the 'explore' in explorer seriously. This ship's ready to chart wormholes, not just star systems!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer09]
"That old explorer had charm, but now it's got charisma. The onboard AI is going to develop a crush on you!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer10]
"You've turned our little explorer into a beacon of discovery. It's practically itching to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer11]
"I thought this vessel was ready for retirement, not reincarnation! You've given it a whole new life as a trailblazer."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer12]
"The last time I saw an explorer this decked out, it was in a historical holovid. You've made history here, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer13]
"This ship used to be about stargazing and note-taking. Now, it's about rewriting the astrophysics textbooks."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer14]
"I've seen researchers with less gear than this ship now. You sure we're not accidentally creating a new branch of science?"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer15]
"With this kind of tech, the ship isn't just exploring the universe; it's ready to teach it a few lessons. Stellar work!"

### Aria's Response: Hauler Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractHauler01]
"Cap, this hauler used to lug cargo. Now? It's a veritable treasure trove on thrusters. The pirates will be green with envy."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler02]
"I never thought a freighter could look chic. You've managed to blend form and function beautifully. It's a mobile masterpiece."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler03]
"The cargo bay had room, but you've given it a whole new dimension! I'm expecting it to start its own trade route with all that space."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler04]
"You've turned this bulky freighter into the belle of the ball. It's not just carrying goods, it's parading them!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler05]
"With this redesign, I'm starting to think 'hauler' is an understatement. This beast could move moons!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler06]
"This freighter's got more hidden compartments than a spy's suitcase now. Smugglers and merchants alike would pay top credit for this kind of craft."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler07]
"Well, I'll be! You've turned this slow-moving giant into a sleek cargo sprinter. It's the Olympic athlete of freighters!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler08]
"The old freighter was a draft horse—sturdy and reliable. You've turned it into a thoroughbred, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler09]
"I used to think this hauler could only be loved by its captain. Now, I think it might just be the belle of the spaceways."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler10]
"Cap, this freighter's now a fortress with a hyperdrive. It's not just moving cargo—it's guarding it."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler11]
"This was once a simple vessel of trade, now it's a titan of transport. You've given commerce a new chariot."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler12]
"You've somehow made this hauler both more spacious and streamlined. It's like you've bent the laws of space inside out."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler13]
"This freighter was as anonymous as a grain of sand on a beach. Now? It's the pearl—unmistakable and invaluable."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler14]
"I'm used to freighters that groan under the weight of their cargo. This one seems ready to dance between the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler15]
"You didn’t just redesign it, you reinvented it. This hauler's ready to write its own legend in the history of interstellar trade."

### Aria's Response: Interceptor Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor01]
"Cap, you’ve turned this into the slickest shadow in the galaxy. It could sneak up on silence itself now."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor02]
"This interceptor was fast before, but you've made it a blur. The stars are going to need to squint."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor03]
"I knew this ship was quick, but you’ve just broken the speed record for making my jaw drop."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor04]
"You've given 'rapid response' a new meaning. This vessel's so fast, it leaves echoes in the vacuum."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor05]
"Who knew this old speedster had such an elegant side? It's like a lightning bolt in a tuxedo now."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor06]
"This interceptor's engines used to roar. Now, they purr with power. Stealth and speed in perfect harmony."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor07]
"Cap, you've taken high-speed to new heights. This thing's going to need its own time zone."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor08]
"The control panel used to look like a museum piece. Now, it's a master class in efficiency. You're an artist."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor09]
"This vessel was meant to chase comets. After your work, I think comets will be chasing it!"

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor10]
"Interceptors are born fast, but you’ve given this one wings. Figuratively speaking, of course."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor11]
"With this kind of speed, we don't need to outrun them; we just circle around and wave goodbye."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor12]
"Cap, you’ve injected such ferocity into this interceptor, I’m half expecting it to just take off on its own."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor13]
"It's not just an interceptor anymore, it's a celestial cheetah. It could catch photons if it wanted to."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor14]
"You've not just redesigned it; you've redefined what it means to be 'fast'. This interceptor is in a league of its own."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor15]
"This speedster could give a black hole a run for its money—and with your upgrades, I'd bet on the ship!"

### Aria's Response: Luxury Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury01]
"Cap, stepping onto this ship is like walking into an intergalactic opera house. The high society of the stars will be lining up for a tour."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury02]
"You've taken luxury to the next level. This vessel doesn't just travel through space; it saunters."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury03]
"This yacht was plush before, but now? It's like you've woven comfort and opulence into every atom."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury04]
"I thought I knew what luxury was until I saw this. You've turned a space cruise into a space conquest of class."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury05]
"They say space is cold, but on this ship, it's always a warm welcome. It's a five-star resort with a warp drive."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury06]
"You've made this more than a luxury vessel; it's a masterpiece that's ready to paint the stars with elegance."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury07]
"Wow, Cap. This yacht used to host parties. Now, it's the event everyone's universe will revolve around."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury08]
"This isn't just a ship; it's a statement. One that says, 'I've arrived, and I brought the horizon with me.'"

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury09]
"The opulence onboard used to whisper. Now, it sings. I can almost hear the cosmic applause."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury10]
"Cap, you've turned this luxury liner into a symphony of sophistication. It's music for the eyes."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury11]
"This vessel was the crown jewel of fleets before, but you've turned it into the entire crown."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury12]
"The harmony of design and comfort here—it's like you've choreographed a ballet of luxury."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury13]
"I've seen luxury, but this? This is legendary. You've crafted a floating myth, a spaceship of lore."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury14]
"This yacht was already a dream, but now? It's a dream that's transcending into a higher realm of opulence."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury15]
"The detailing here is exquisite. Every inch now tells a tale of luxury so rich, even the stars might come down for a closer look."

## Misc Scenes: RAW

Certainly! I'll provide a detailed dialogue scenario with four varied player responses and Aria's reply to each.

[Hidden Fears]
Aria: "In all the galaxy's vastness, Cap, I sometimes worry... What if my designs never take flight? What if they're destined to remain just... sketches?"

[Player Response Options]
[Player Reassuring]

"Your talent's as boundless as the cosmos, Aria. Those designs will soar, I'm sure of it."
[Player Pragmatic]
"It's a tough industry, but good designs stand out. Keep at it, and they'll find their way into the stars."
[Player Ambitious]
"Then we'll make them take flight together. No sketch is too ambitious when you've got the right team."
[Player Blunt]
"You can't let fear hold you back. In space, hesitation isn't just a setback, it's a liability."
[Aria's Response to Player Reassuring]
Aria: "I appreciate that, Cap. Your confidence in me... it's like a supernova boost to my spirit."

[Aria's Response to Player Pragmatic]
Aria: "That's just the kind of grounded advice I need sometimes. You've got a way of simplifying the stars, you know?"

[Aria's Response to Player Ambitious]
Aria: "With you? I believe it. We're like binary stars, stronger together. Let's turn those sketches into legends."

[Aria's Response to Player Blunt]
Aria: "Sharp words, but there's truth there. Space doesn't coddle dreamers. I'll remember that next time I hesitate."

This approach allows Aria to react differently to the player's attitude and input, showcasing her adaptability and emotional range. It also allows the player to influence the tone of their relationship and Aria's development within the game.
