[SceneAriaLegacy]

[PlayerLegacyInquiry]
Player: "With all the work you put into these ships, Aria, what do you hope to leave behind?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaLegacy01]
"I'm crafting vessels that'll endure the test of time and space. I want my name to be synonymous with innovation, to be whispered in every shipyard and academy."

[AriaLegacy02]
"To me, it's about the here and now—making a ship that changes a life today, not just one that's idolized tomorrow. If I can do that, I've succeeded."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerLegacyResponseAdmiration]
"That’s a noble pursuit. To create something that lasts beyond ourselves, it's the dream of every true engineer."

[PlayerLegacyResponseRealistic]
"Remember, the most enduring legacy is the advancements we make, not the recognition we get."

[PlayerLegacyResponseCautious]
"It's important to have goals, but make sure you're also living in the moment, not just for the future."

[PlayerLegacyResponseProvocative]
"Legacy is a heavy load to carry. Are you building for the ages, or are you searching for something else in your work?"

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaLegacyReponseToAdmiration]
"Thank you, Cap. It's the kind of dream that keeps you up at night—in a good way. And when one of my ships launches, it feels like a piece of that dream becoming real."

[AriaLegacyResponseToRealistic]
"That's true. The stars don't care about fame, do they? It's the journey there, the breakthroughs that make the trip possible—that's the real legacy."

[AriaLegacyResponseToCautious]
"You've got a point. Sometimes I'm so focused on the blueprint in front of me that I forget to look up and just watch the stars."

[AriaLegacyResponseToProvocative]
"Maybe it is a bit of both. I pour my heart into these ships, but maybe... maybe I'm also trying to chart my own course, find where I truly belong among the stars."
