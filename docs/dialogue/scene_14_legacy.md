# Scene 14: Legacy and Impact - Vulnerability and Defensiveness

[SceneAriaLegacy]

[PlayerLegacyInquiry]
Player: "You're pouring so much into these ship designs, Aria. What kind of legacy are you hoping to build?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaLegacy01]
_Aria's voice carries a mix of passion and a hint of defensiveness._ "Legacy? I'm here to revolutionize space travel. To be a name that changed the industry, not just a footnote in its history."

[AriaLegacy02]
_She softens slightly,_ "But it's not just about making a name. It's about today's work impacting tomorrow. If my ships can inspire or protect, then I've done my job."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerLegacyResponseSupport]
"Your determination is admirable. You're not just building ships; you're building the future. That's a legacy in itself."

[PlayerLegacyResponseThoughtful]
"It's good to aim high, but remember, the greatest legacies are often the unexpected impacts, the ripples we create."

[PlayerLegacyResponseConcern]
"It's great to have goals, Aria, but don't get lost chasing them. Sometimes the best legacy is a life well-lived, not just well-worked."

[PlayerLegacyResponseChallenging]
"A legacy, huh? Is this about making a mark, or is there something deeper you're searching for in your work?"

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaLegacyResponseToSupport]
_She nods, her eyes bright._ "Thanks, that's the plan. To push the boundaries, to leave something lasting and meaningful."

[AriaLegacyResponseToThoughtful]
_Her gaze drifts, contemplative._ "I never thought of it that way. Maybe the legacy isn't just the ships, but the journeys they enable, the stories they become part of."

[AriaLegacyResponseToConcern]
_A moment of genuine reflection crosses her face._ "You're right; it's easy to get caught up. I've been so focused on the destination, I might be missing the journey."

[AriaLegacyResponseToChallenging]
_Aria's response is tinged with defensiveness, her expression firm._ "Look, I know what I'm doing. This isn't just about making my mark. It's about fulfilling a vision, a purpose. Sure, I'm driven, but who isn't in this field? I'm here to make a difference, and that's exactly what I plan to do."
