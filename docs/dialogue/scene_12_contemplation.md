# Scene 12: Contemplation

[SceneAriaContemplation]

[AriaContemplation]
Aria: "Staring out into the abyss of space, it sometimes feels like it gazes back, probing the decisions I've made. It's a bit unnerving. Does space ever get under your skin, Cap?"

## Player Response Options

[PlayerContemplationResponseComforting]
"Seeing the vastness out there, it's normal to feel that way. But remember, you're the one charting the course, not the void."

[PlayerContemplationResponseUnderstanding]
"It's the same for all of us. That infinite expanse has a way of putting things into perspective."

[PlayerContemplationResponseInquisitive]
"Do you think it's the void questioning you, or are you questioning yourself?"

[PlayerContemplationResponsePhilosophical]
"The universe asks the tough questions, but that's how we find the answers that matter."

## Aria's Responses to Player's choice

[AriaContemplationResponseToComforting]
"I appreciate your words. They're like a beacon on a dark night. Sometimes I just need that little bit of light."

[AriaContemplationResponseToUnderstanding]
"Yeah? It's comforting to know I'm not alone in that feeling. We're all just trying to make sense of our place in this vastness."

[AriaContemplationResponseToInquisitive]
"That's an insightful question. Maybe it's a bit of both. Space reflects our own doubts, doesn't it? It's a mirror as much as it is a void."

[AriaContemplationResponseToPhilosophical]
"You're right. It's the questions that drive us, that push us to explore further. Thanks for that clarity, Cap."
