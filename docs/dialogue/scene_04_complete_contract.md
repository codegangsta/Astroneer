"Finished with the ship. How does it measure up to our standards?"

[PlayerCompleteContract03]
"Completed the contract. What's your take on the final product?"

[PlayerCompleteContract04]
"Just finished my design. Will it pass the Aria test?"

[PlayerCompleteContract05]
"Redesign's done. Does it have the Aria stamp of approval?"

[PlayerCompleteContract06]
"Contract's done. I'm eager to hear your thoughts."

[PlayerCompleteContract07]
"Wrapped up the ship. It should meet the mark."

[PlayerCompleteContract08]

## Aria's Response: Fighter Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractFighter01]
"Talk about an upgrade! This fighter's not just ready for action; it's practically auditioning for the lead role in a space saga."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter02]
"It's like you armed it with stealth and style. Ready to tango with the toughest out there."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter03]
"Wow, you've turned it fierce! Space might think twice before picking a fight with this one."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter04]
"Sleek and sharp – it's like the sports car of space fighters. Ready to dodge stars and break hearts!"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter05]
"'Good job'? More like a stellar triumph! This fighter's ready to star in its own space epic."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter06]
"Speed and agility in perfect harmony – like a ballet dancer with a blaster. It's poetry in motion!"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter07]
"This fighter's gone from bulky to balletic. It's slim, trim, and ready for a cosmic gym."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter08]
"Those engines are purring with power. It's a beast in the best way possible."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter09]
"Precision and power, all in one package. It's like you've crafted a space scalpel."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter10]
"It's got a sting to rival a squadron of space wasps. Watch out, galaxy, this fighter's got attitude."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter11]
"You've infused it with spirit – this fighter's got more personality than some pilots I know!"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter12]
"The thrusters feel supercharged! It's like they're raring to rip through the cosmos."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter13]
"This isn't just a fighter; it's a space slicer. Looks like it could carve up constellations!"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter14]
"You've turned it into a cosmic predator – sleek, swift, and a little scary. I love it!"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter15]
"What a transformation! This isn't just an upgrade; it's a revolution. The fighter's in a whole new galaxy of cool."

## Aria's Response: Explorer Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer01]
"Wow, this explorer's now a cosmic mapmaker. It's got flair and function!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer02]
"It's a universe on wheels! Or should I say thrusters? Great touch with the library vibe."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer03]
"The sensors are singing about galaxies far away. You've really dialed up their tune."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer04]
"You've given it a pioneer's spirit. This ship's ready to write its own odyssey."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer05]
"This ship's a Swiss Army knife of space! Is there a button for brewing coffee too?"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer06]
"It's not just equipped; it's enlightened. This research vessel's got a Ph.D. in Awesome."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer07]
"Space and luxury! Researchers will queue up for this. It's a lab with a view."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer08]
"Ready to nose-dive into black holes now, eh? It's a cosmic detective!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer09]
"Smart and stylish – the AI might start giving fashion tips next!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer10]
"This ship's ready to spill the universe's secrets over a cup of cosmic tea."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer11]
"Old explorer, new tricks. It's jazzed up for some serious star-hopping."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer12]
"You've turned it into a time traveler's dream. This ship's history in the making."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer13]
"From stargazing to star-blazing! It's a mobile masterclass in astrophysics."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer14]
"This ship's got gadgets Galileo would envy. Ready for some high-tech treasure hunts!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer15]
"It's not just exploring; it's tutoring the cosmos. A real mentorship in motion!"

## Aria's Response: Hauler Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractHauler01]
"Cap, this hauler used to lug cargo. Now? It's a veritable treasure trove on thrusters. The pirates will be green with envy."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler02]
"I never thought a freighter could look chic. You've managed to blend form and function beautifully. It's a mobile masterpiece."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler03]
"The cargo bay had room, but you've given it a whole new dimension! I'm expecting it to start its own trade route with all that space."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler04]
"You've turned this bulky freighter into the belle of the ball. It's not just carrying goods, it's parading them!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler05]
"With this redesign, I'm starting to think 'hauler' is an understatement. This beast could move moons!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler06]
"This freighter's got more hidden compartments than a spy's suitcase now. Smugglers and merchants alike would pay top credit for this kind of craft."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler07]
"Well, I'll be! You've turned this slow-moving giant into a sleek cargo sprinter. It's the Olympic athlete of freighters!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler08]
"The old freighter was a draft horse—sturdy and reliable. You've turned it into a thoroughbred, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler09]
"I used to think this hauler could only be loved by its captain. Now, I think it might just be the darling of the spaceways."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler10]
"Cap, this freighter's now a fortress with a hyperdrive. It's not just moving cargo—it's guarding it."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler11]
"This was once a simple vessel of trade, now it's a titan of transport. You've given commerce a new chariot."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler12]
"You've somehow made this hauler both more spacious and streamlined. It's like you've bent the laws of space inside out."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler13]
"This freighter was as anonymous as a grain of sand on a beach. Now? It's the pearl—unmistakable and invaluable."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler14]
"I'm used to freighters that groan under the weight of their cargo. This one seems ready to dance between the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler15]
"You didn’t just redesign it, you reinvented it. This hauler's ready to write its own legend in the history of interstellar trade."

## Aria's Response: Interceptor Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor01]
"Cap, you’ve turned this into the slickest shadow in the galaxy. It could sneak up on silence itself now."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor02]
"This interceptor was fast before, but you've made it a blur. The stars are going to need to squint."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor03]
"I knew this ship was quick, but you’ve just broken the speed record for making my jaw drop."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor04]
"You've given 'rapid response' a new meaning. This vessel's so fast, it leaves echoes in the vacuum."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor05]
"Who knew this old speedster had such an elegant side? It's like a lightning bolt in a tuxedo now."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor06]
"This interceptor's engines used to roar. Now, they purr with power. Stealth and speed in perfect harmony."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor07]
"Cap, you've taken high-speed to new heights. This thing's going to need its own time zone."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor08]
"The control panel used to look like a museum piece. Now, it's a master class in efficiency. You're an artist."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor09]
"This vessel was meant to chase comets. After your work, I think comets will be chasing it!"

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor10]
"Interceptors are born fast, but you’ve given this one wings. Figuratively speaking, of course."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor11]
"With this kind of speed, we don't need to outrun them; we just circle around and wave goodbye."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor12]
"Cap, you’ve injected such ferocity into this interceptor, I’m half expecting it to just take off on its own."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor13]
"It's not just an interceptor anymore, it's a celestial cheetah. It could catch photons if it wanted to."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor14]
"You've not just redesigned it; you've redefined what it means to be 'fast'. This interceptor is in a league of its own."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor15]
"This speedster could give a black hole a run for its money—and with your upgrades, I'd bet on the ship!"

## Aria's Response: Luxury Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury01]
"Cap, stepping onto this ship is like walking into an intergalactic opera house. The high society of the stars will be lining up for a tour."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury02]
"You've taken luxury to the next level. This vessel doesn't just travel through space; it saunters."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury03]
"This yacht was plush before, but now? It's like you've woven comfort and opulence into every atom."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury04]
"I thought I knew what luxury was until I saw this. You've turned a space cruise into a space conquest of class."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury05]
"They say space is cold, but on this ship, it's always a warm welcome. It's a five-star resort with a grav drive."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury06]
"You've made this more than a luxury vessel; it's a masterpiece that's ready to paint the stars with elegance."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury07]
"Wow, Cap. This yacht used to host parties. Now, it's the event everyone's universe will revolve around."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury08]
"This isn't just a ship; it's a statement. One that says, 'I've arrived, and I brought the horizon with me.'"

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury09]
"The opulence onboard used to whisper. Now, it sings. I can almost hear the cosmic applause."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury10]
"Cap, you've turned this luxury liner into a symphony of sophistication. It's music for the eyes."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury11]
"This vessel was the crown jewel of fleets before, but you've turned it into the entire crown."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury12]
"The harmony of design and comfort here—it's like you've choreographed a ballet of luxury."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury13]
"I've seen luxury, but this? This is legendary. You've crafted a floating myth, a spaceship of lore."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury14]
"This yacht was already a dream, but now? It's a dream that's transcending into a higher realm of opulence."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury15]
"The detailing here is exquisite. Every inch now tells a tale of luxury so rich, even the stars might come down for a closer look."
