_Context: The player has finished building the ship according to the contract specs, and is ready to turn it in to Aria._

## Player Dialogue

[PlayerCompleteContract01]
"Design's in. Does it capture what you were looking for?"

[PlayerCompleteContract02]
"Finished with the ship. How does it measure up to our standards?"

[PlayerCompleteContract03]
"Completed the contract. What's your take on the final product?"

[PlayerCompleteContract04]
"Just finished my design. Will it pass the Aria test?"

[PlayerCompleteContract05]
"Redesign's done. Does it have the Aria stamp of approval?"

[PlayerCompleteContract06]
"Contract's done. I'm eager to hear your thoughts."

[PlayerCompleteContract07]
"Wrapped up the ship. It should meet the mark."

[PlayerCompleteContract08]
"Finished the upgrade. It's ready for your review."

[PlayerCompleteContract09]
"The ship's reimagined, per your vision."

[PlayerCompleteContract10]
"Ship is done. It's a fresh take on an old classic."

## Aria's Response: Generic

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric01]
"Cap, you've given this vessel a new heartbeat. It's almost as if it's breathing the cosmos."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric02]
"This redesign... it's like you took the ship's dreams and turned them into a reality. Simply stunning."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric03]
"You've not just changed the ship; you've transformed the way it'll carve its path through the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric04]
"I always say a ship has personality, but this? You've given it a soul, and a rather charismatic one at that."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric05]
"The craftsmanship here is sublime. You've taken ship design from a profession to an art form."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric06]
"You've made turning heads into an interstellar sport with this design. Bravo, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric07]
"I've seen ships with flair, but this is something else. It's like the universe tailor-made it."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric08]
"This ship used to whisper through the void. Now, it sings. And what a beautiful song it's chosen."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric09]
"You've managed to capture the essence of flight in this design. It's poetry in motion, even while docked."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric10]
"Every once in a while, a ship comes along that reminds us why we took to the stars. This is that ship."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric11]
"Cap, this ship's not just ready to face the galaxy; it's ready to become its legend."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric12]
"The lines, the form, the exquisite detail... you've not just redesigned a ship; you've reimagined what it means to travel the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric13]
"There's a fine line between a ship and a symphony. You, my friend, have composed a masterpiece."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric14]
"This vessel now has the kind of allure that could make a black hole think twice about swallowing it up."

[AriaCompleteContractGeneric15]
"It's one thing to make a ship functional, another to make it beautiful, but you've done both—with style to spare."

## Aria's Response: Fighter Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractFighter01]
"Cap, you’ve turned this fighter into a celestial falcon. Those wings aren't just for show, huh?"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter02]
"Wow, it's like you gave it claws and a cloaking device. This fighter's ready to dance with the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter03]
"Is it just me, or did you somehow make the vacuum of space afraid of this ship? That's some fierce redesign."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter04]
"You've taken 'sleek' to new levels. This baby could slip through a meteor shower unscathed."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter05]
"I would say 'good job,' but that wouldn't cover it. You've crafted something reaaaally special here."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter06]
"Impressive. You've managed to make speed and agility shake hands. That's one harmonious fighter."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter07]
"I've seen shooting stars bulkier than this. You've really trimmed the fat and boosted the muscle."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter08]
"The engines purr like a kitten, but we both know this thing roars like a tiger in the void."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter09]
"By the stars, you've turned a blunt instrument into a scalpel. Precision and power in one package—beautiful."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter10]
"You've given this fighter a sting that would make a wasp jealous. I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter11]
"I always say a ship has to have spirit, and you've given this one a soul. A fast, furious soul, but a soul nonetheless."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter12]
"The thrusters! Did you do something with the thrusters? Because it feels like it's ready to jump out of its own hull."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter13]
"This fighter looks like it could cut through space-time. Did you add a few extra dimensions to it or what?"

[AriaCompleteContractFighter14]
"I've heard of putting a tiger in your tank, but you put one in the whole ship! It's ready to pounce on any challenge."

[AriaCompleteContractFighter15]
"That’s not just a redesign, it's a reimagining. You've not only raised the bar, you've shot it into orbit!"

## Aria's Response: Explorer Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer01]
"Cap, this isn't just an explorer—it's a cosmic cartographer now. The stars are going to line up for a peek inside!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer02]
"I always knew this hull had secrets, but you've turned it into a library of the universe. Well done!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer03]
"The sensors on this vessel used to whisper, now they sing symphonies about distant galaxies. You've outdone yourself."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer04]
"You've turned a simple explorer into a pioneer's dream. It's like a compass pointing straight to the heart of adventure."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer05]
"With this redesign, I'm half expecting it to unfold into a space station. You've packed in everything but the kitchen sink—wait, is that a kitchen sink?"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer06]
"You've not just crossed the 'T's and dotted the 'I's, you rewrote the whole alphabet. This research vessel is a thesis in space engineering."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer07]
"The labs were cramped and the living quarters were... quaint. Now? It's a five-star hotel with a science wing. Impressive."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer08]
"You took the 'explore' in explorer seriously. This ship's ready to chart wormholes, not just star systems!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer09]
"That old explorer had charm, but now it's got charisma. The onboard AI is going to develop a crush on you!"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer10]
"You've turned our little explorer into a beacon of discovery. It's practically itching to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer11]
"I thought this vessel was ready for retirement, not reincarnation! You've given it a whole new life as a trailblazer."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer12]
"The last time I saw an explorer this decked out, it was in a historical holovid. You've made history here, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer13]
"This ship used to be about stargazing and note-taking. Now, it's about rewriting the astrophysics textbooks."

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer14]
"I've seen researchers with less gear than this ship now. You sure we're not accidentally creating a new branch of science?"

[AriaCompleteContractExplorer15]
"With this kind of tech, the ship isn't just exploring the universe; it's ready to teach it a few lessons. Stellar work!"

## Aria's Response: Hauler Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractHauler01]
"Cap, this hauler used to lug cargo. Now? It's a veritable treasure trove on thrusters. The pirates will be green with envy."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler02]
"I never thought a freighter could look chic. You've managed to blend form and function beautifully. It's a mobile masterpiece."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler03]
"The cargo bay had room, but you've given it a whole new dimension! I'm expecting it to start its own trade route with all that space."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler04]
"You've turned this bulky freighter into the belle of the ball. It's not just carrying goods, it's parading them!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler05]
"With this redesign, I'm starting to think 'hauler' is an understatement. This beast could move moons!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler06]
"This freighter's got more hidden compartments than a spy's suitcase now. Smugglers and merchants alike would pay top credit for this kind of craft."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler07]
"Well, I'll be! You've turned this slow-moving giant into a sleek cargo sprinter. It's the Olympic athlete of freighters!"

[AriaCompleteContractHauler08]
"The old freighter was a draft horse—sturdy and reliable. You've turned it into a thoroughbred, Cap."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler09]
"I used to think this hauler could only be loved by its captain. Now, I think it might just be the belle of the spaceways."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler10]
"Cap, this freighter's now a fortress with a hyperdrive. It's not just moving cargo—it's guarding it."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler11]
"This was once a simple vessel of trade, now it's a titan of transport. You've given commerce a new chariot."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler12]
"You've somehow made this hauler both more spacious and streamlined. It's like you've bent the laws of space inside out."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler13]
"This freighter was as anonymous as a grain of sand on a beach. Now? It's the pearl—unmistakable and invaluable."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler14]
"I'm used to freighters that groan under the weight of their cargo. This one seems ready to dance between the stars."

[AriaCompleteContractHauler15]
"You didn’t just redesign it, you reinvented it. This hauler's ready to write its own legend in the history of interstellar trade."

## Aria's Response: Interceptor Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor01]
"Cap, you’ve turned this into the slickest shadow in the galaxy. It could sneak up on silence itself now."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor02]
"This interceptor was fast before, but you've made it a blur. The stars are going to need to squint."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor03]
"I knew this ship was quick, but you’ve just broken the speed record for making my jaw drop."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor04]
"You've given 'rapid response' a new meaning. This vessel's so fast, it leaves echoes in the vacuum."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor05]
"Who knew this old speedster had such an elegant side? It's like a lightning bolt in a tuxedo now."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor06]
"This interceptor's engines used to roar. Now, they purr with power. Stealth and speed in perfect harmony."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor07]
"Cap, you've taken high-speed to new heights. This thing's going to need its own time zone."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor08]
"The control panel used to look like a museum piece. Now, it's a master class in efficiency. You're an artist."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor09]
"This vessel was meant to chase comets. After your work, I think comets will be chasing it!"

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor10]
"Interceptors are born fast, but you’ve given this one wings. Figuratively speaking, of course."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor11]
"With this kind of speed, we don't need to outrun them; we just circle around and wave goodbye."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor12]
"Cap, you’ve injected such ferocity into this interceptor, I’m half expecting it to just take off on its own."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor13]
"It's not just an interceptor anymore, it's a celestial cheetah. It could catch photons if it wanted to."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor14]
"You've not just redesigned it; you've redefined what it means to be 'fast'. This interceptor is in a league of its own."

[AriaCompleteContractInterceptor15]
"This speedster could give a black hole a run for its money—and with your upgrades, I'd bet on the ship!"

## Aria's Response: Luxury Ship Type

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury01]
"Cap, stepping onto this ship is like walking into an intergalactic opera house. The high society of the stars will be lining up for a tour."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury02]
"You've taken luxury to the next level. This vessel doesn't just travel through space; it saunters."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury03]
"This yacht was plush before, but now? It's like you've woven comfort and opulence into every atom."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury04]
"I thought I knew what luxury was until I saw this. You've turned a space cruise into a space conquest of class."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury05]
"They say space is cold, but on this ship, it's always a warm welcome. It's a five-star resort with a warp drive."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury06]
"You've made this more than a luxury vessel; it's a masterpiece that's ready to paint the stars with elegance."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury07]
"Wow, Cap. This yacht used to host parties. Now, it's the event everyone's universe will revolve around."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury08]
"This isn't just a ship; it's a statement. One that says, 'I've arrived, and I brought the horizon with me.'"

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury09]
"The opulence onboard used to whisper. Now, it sings. I can almost hear the cosmic applause."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury10]
"Cap, you've turned this luxury liner into a symphony of sophistication. It's music for the eyes."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury11]
"This vessel was the crown jewel of fleets before, but you've turned it into the entire crown."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury12]
"The harmony of design and comfort here—it's like you've choreographed a ballet of luxury."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury13]
"I've seen luxury, but this? This is legendary. You've crafted a floating myth, a spaceship of lore."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury14]
"This yacht was already a dream, but now? It's a dream that's transcending into a higher realm of opulence."

[AriaCompleteContractLuxury15]
"The detailing here is exquisite. Every inch now tells a tale of luxury so rich, even the stars might come down for a closer look."
