# Scene 07: Colony Life

[SceneAriaColonyLife]
_In this scene, Aria reminisces about her childhood, providing the player with a glimpse into the environment that honed her creativity and tenacity. Her responses reflect how those early experiences have a direct correlation with her current skills and attitudes._

[PlayerColonyLifeInquiry]
Player: "Growing up on a colony must have been quite an experience. What was daily life like for you back then?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaColonyLife01]
"Imagine a place where every broken gadget could be a treasure, where each discarded panel or wire could be part of a spaceship or a robot. It was a tinkerer's paradise. We made our own fun, our own little worlds out of the refuse. It was tough, but it was creative freedom."

[AriaColonyLife02]
"It was about making the most of what you had, which wasn't much. A colony doesn't give you soft landings—you fall, you get back up. You learn from the machine's hum and the hull's echo. It was a tough life, but it forged me, shaped me into who I am."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerColonyLifeResponseAdmireImagination]
"That sounds like an incubator for creativity. No wonder you’re so innovative with your designs."

[PlayerColonyLifeResponseCuriousImagination]
"Did that freedom shape your aspirations? Is that why you're driven to design ships?"

[PlayerColonyLifeResponseAdmireResilience]
"It's that resilience that must give you such a strong drive now. Those lessons seem invaluable."

[PlayerColonyLifeResponseCuriousResilience]
"Sounds like those conditions prepared you well for the cutthroat world of ship design and beyond."

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaColonyLifeResponseToAdmireImagination]
"It absolutely did. When you're used to imagining possibilities from piles of spare parts, you start seeing potential everywhere—even in the darkest reaches of space."

[AriaColonyLifeResponseToCuriousImagination]
"In a way, yes. There's a certain kind of magic in creation that's addictive. What started with scraps turned into a quest to build ships that explore the stars."

[AriaColonyLifeResponseToAdmireResilience]
"I think you're onto something. The colony life didn't just teach me how to endure—it taught me to turn endurance into energy. Into drive."

[AriaColonyLifeResponseToCuriousResilience]
"You could say that. When you've negotiated for parts in a colony market, haggling over reactor specs with suppliers is a breeze. And the politics? Just another day's negotiation."
