# Scene 12: Bad News from home

[SceneAriaBadNews]

[AriaBadNewsInquiry]
_Aria appears on the intercom, her usual vibrancy dimmed, her tone subdued._
"Hey, Cap... Sorry, I'm a bit out of sorts today. What's up?"

## Initial Player Response Options

[PlayerBadNewsResponseConcerned]
"You don’t seem yourself. Anything you want to share?"

[PlayerBadNewsResponseGentleProbing]
"You're usually more animated, Aria. Is something troubling you?"

[PlayerBadNewsResponseRespectfulDistance]
"If you're not up for talking, that's okay. We can keep it work-related if you prefer."

[PlayerBadNewsResponseDirect]
"You look like something's weighing on you. If you want to talk, I'm here."

## Initial Aria's Responses

[AriaBadNewsResponseToConcerned]
_She hesitates, offering a strained smile._ "Just family things, you know? It's tough being so far away sometimes."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToGentleProbing]
_Aria lets out a soft sigh._ "It's hard to hide anything from you, isn't it? Just some news from back home. Makes you think about life choices."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToRespectfulDistance]
_Gratefully nodding_ "Thanks for understanding. Let's just focus on work today. Helps to keep the mind occupied."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToDirect]
_Pausing briefly_ "I appreciate your straightforwardness. It's my little sister; shes ill. And I'm here, worlds away."

## Follow-up Player Response Options

[PlayerBadNewsFollowupResponseSympathetic]
"It's tough, being so far. If talking about it helps, I'm here to listen."

[PlayerBadNewsFollowupResponseInquisitive]
"Do you feel like being here, pursuing your dreams, is worth the distance from family?"

[PlayerBadNewsFollowupResponseSupportive]
"Focus on what you can control, Aria. You're doing important work here."

[PlayerBadNewsFollowupResponseNonIntrusive]
"We don’t have to talk about it more if you don’t want to. Just know, you’re not alone."

## Additional Player Response Options (After Aria Reveals About Her Sister)

_If Aria directly reveals the news about her sister, the player's response options can be tailored to offer more in-depth emotional support, advice, or shared empathy. Here are additional player response options for that scenario:_

[PlayerBadNewsResponseEmpathy]
"It's never easy to be away from family, especially in times like these. If you need to talk or just take a break, I'm here."

[PlayerBadNewsResponsePracticalSupport]
"That's tough to hear. Are there ways we can help from here? Maybe there's something we can do, even from afar."

[PlayerBadNewsResponseSharedExperience]
"I've been there, Aria. Distance can make these things harder. Just remember, she knows you're thinking of her."

[PlayerBadNewsResponseEncouragingOptimism]
"I'm sorry about your sister. Let's hold onto hope, though. Sometimes, good news can travel just as fast as the bad."

[PlayerBadNewsResponseOfferSpace]
"If you need some time to process this or make a call, take all the time you need. Work can wait."

## Aria's Responses to Additional Player Options

[AriaBadNewsResponseToEmpathy]
_Aria's eyes reflect gratitude._ "Thanks. It means a lot just knowing you're here to listen. Makes the distance feel a little less vast."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToPracticalSupport]
_She considers this._ "That's a kind thought. Maybe there's something we can do from here. I'll think about it. Thank you."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToSharedExperience]
"You can see the comfort in her expression. "It helps to know someone understands. Just having people around who get it... it's a big deal."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToEncouragingOptimism]
_Her smile is small but genuine._ "Optimism, right? I need a bit of that right now. Thanks for the reminder to stay hopeful."

[AriaBadNewsResponseToOfferSpace]
_Relief washes over her._ "I might take you up on that. Just a little time to gather my thoughts could help. Thanks, Cap."

## Follow-up Aria's Responses

[AriaBadNewsFollowupResponseToSympathetic]
_Her eyes soften._ "Thanks, it means a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, being here while my family's back there."

[AriaBadNewsFollowupResponseToInquisitive]
_She looks thoughtful._ "That's the question, isn't it? I believe in what I'm doing here, but at moments like this, I question the cost."

[AriaBadNewsFollowupResponseToSupportive]
_A nod of acknowledgement._ "You're right. I chose this path for a reason. Just need to remember why on days like this."

[AriaBadNewsFollowupResponseToNonIntrusive]
_There's a hint of relief in her voice._ "I appreciate that, really. Sometimes just knowing someone's there to listen is enough."
