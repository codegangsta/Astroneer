# Scene 11: Reflecting on Personal Growth

[SceneAriaReflect]

[AriaReflectInquiry]
Aria: "You know, I've been so caught up in alloys and engine schematics, I barely noticed the stars. How do you find time to reflect on your journey among them?"

## Player Response Options

[PlayerReflectResponseBalance]
"Finding balance isn't easy, but I try to take a step back now and then to enjoy the view."

[PlayerReflectResponseDriven]
"To be honest, I'm too driven to stop and ponder. The journey's only a means to an end for me."

[PlayerReflectResponsePhilosophical]
"I see each star as a milestone, a story in my journey. It's not just about the destination, you know?"

[PlayerReflectResponsePractical]
"Reflection is a luxury. In this line of work, you focus on the job at hand, or you're space dust."

## Aria's Responses to Player's Reflection

[AriaReflectResponseToBalance]
"That's a wise approach. Maybe I should install a window in the workshop, keep the cosmic perspective alive. Thanks for the reminder, Cap."

[AriaReflectResponseToDriven]
"I get that. The finish line keeps moving in this industry. Just don't burn out before you get to enjoy your victories, alright?"

[AriaReflectResponseToPhilosophical]
"I like that. Each system we pass through, each world we chartâ€”it's part of us. Maybe I'll start collecting stars instead of stress."

[AriaReflectResponseToPractical]
"Harsh but fair. This galaxy waits for no one. Still, don't let the dust blind you to what we're out here for. Even a moment's peace can save your sanity."
