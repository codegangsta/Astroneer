[PlayerAlternatePathsInquiry]
Player: "Do you ever look back and consider what life might have been if you’d stayed with the corporations?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaAlternativePaths01]
"The thought crosses my mind from time to time. But every time I see a ship that I had a hand in, every time I solve a problem that seemed insurmountable, I’m reminded why I left. It reaffirms my path."

[AriaAlternativePaths02]
"I used to play the 'what if' game a lot. What if I’d stayed, played it safe, climbed that ladder... But now, I blaze my own trails. It’s more uncertain, but infinitely more rewarding."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerAlternatePathsResponseEncouraging]
"It sounds like you made the right call. You’re not just following blueprints; you’re creating them."

[PlayerAlternatePathsResponseInquisitive]
"Do you think the stability and resources of a corporation would’ve helped you achieve more, or less?"

[PlayerAlternatePathsResponseSupportive]
"There’s something to be said for carving your own path. It’s brave, and it seems to suit you."

[PlayerAlternatePathsResponseRealistic]
"It’s a big gamble, leaving a sure thing for the unknown. Not many have the courage to do that."

## Aria’s Follow-up Responses

[AriaAlternatePathsResponseToEncouraging]
Aria: "Thanks, Cap. It’s not easy to step off the beaten path, but I believe in the work we’re doing here. We’re not just building ships; we’re building dreams."

[AriaAlternatePathsResponseToInquisitive]
Aria: "You know, I've asked myself that. Maybe I’d have more resources, but I’d have less freedom. Here, each ship is a piece of me—that's something money can’t buy."

[AriaAlternatePathsResponseToSupportive]
Aria: "It suits me like a custom spacesuit. Sure, it’s a risk. But what's life without a little thrill? The view from the mountain I'm climbing is spectacular."

[AriaAlternatePathsResponseToRealistic]
Aria: "Courage or craziness, it's a fine line. But I figure, if you're going to bet, bet on yourself. So far, it’s paying off."
