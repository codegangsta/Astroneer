[SceneAriaRegret]
_This emotionally complex scene starts with Aria's rare moment of vulnerability about her family, which she either opens up more about or distances herself from, depending on the player's approach._

[PlayerRegretInquiry]
Player: "Your dedication to your career is clear, Aria. But how has this journey affected your ties with family?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaRegret01]
_Aria's facade momentarily slips, revealing a raw, emotional undercurrent._ "It's... it's been hard. I've been so wrapped up in my work, I've let those connections fade. It's one of those things you don't notice until it hits you."

[AriaRegret02]
_Her voice quivers slightly, then steadies._ "I left for the stars so young, so eager. I told myself it was for the greater good, but... I missed so much back home. It's a silence that's grown too loud to ignore."

"It's a tough balance to strike. Maybe it's not too late to start bridging that gap, to reconnect."

[PlayerRegretResponsePractical]
"Your achievements are incredible, but sometimes, reconnecting with family can bring a different sense of accomplishment."

[PlayerRegretResponseProbing]
"Is that silence something you're thinking of addressing? It might bring you a different kind of peace."

[PlayerRegretResponseDismissive]
"Well, sacrifices are part of the job, right? You can’t reach the stars without leaving something behind."

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaRegretResponseToCompassionate]
_The vulnerability in Aria’s voice is palpable, her usual confidence replaced by a rare sense of fear._ "You might be right, but... it terrifies me. The thought of reaching out after all this time, facing them... it feels like standing on the edge of a black hole. I don't know if I'm ready to confront that darkness yet."

[AriaRegretResponseToPractical]
_There's a shift in her demeanor, a mix of acceptance and hesitation._ "You have a point. My work has always been my focus, but... maybe there's room for both in my life."

[AriaRegretResponseToProbing]
_A brief flicker of contemplation crosses her face, then she retreats slightly._ "It's something I'm wrestling with. Maybe addressing it will bring peace, but... let's just say I'm not there yet."

[AriaRegretResponseToDismissive]
_Her defenses snap back up, the vulnerability gone._ "Exactly. You get it. Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, right? I've made my choice, for better or worse."
