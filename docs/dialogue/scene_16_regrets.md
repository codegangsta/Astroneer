## Aria's Responses

[AriaRegret01]
Aria: "Every day. I was so focused on reaching the stars, I forgot the ones waiting for me at home. Missed birthdays, anniversaries... I always thought I'd make it up to them 'one day.' But you know how fast 'one day' flies by in space."

[AriaRegret02]
Aria: "I left home young, chasing dreams across the galaxy. I told myself I was doing it for them, for a better future. But deep down, I know I also did it for me. And the cost... was more moments with them than I care to count."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerRegretResponseUnderstanding]
"Family always understands, Aria. Maybe it's time to reconnect, share your successes and dreams with them."

[PlayerRegretResponseRealistic]
"Your ambitions brought you here, and that's not something to regret. Maybe there's a way to bridge the distance now."

[PlayerRegretResponseReflective]
"It's tough, balancing dreams with family. But those dreams are also a legacy you're building for them."

[PlayerRegretResponseHopeful]
"It's never too late to make new memories, Aria. The stars you've chased can light the way back home."

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaRegretResponseToUnderstanding]
"You're right. I think they've always been my silent cheerleaders. It's time I shared more of my world with them. Thanks for the reminder."

[AriaRegretResponseToRealistic]
"That's one way to look at it. I've been building bridges in the stars, maybe it's time to build a few back to home."

[AriaRegretResponseToReflective]
"That's a comforting perspective. I've been leaving trails in the stars for them, in a way. Now, maybe it's time to walk some of those trails together."

[AriaRegretResponseToHopeful]
"New memories... I like that. It's not just about what I missed, but what I can still create. I've always been good at building things, after all."
