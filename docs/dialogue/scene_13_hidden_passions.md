[PlayerPassionInquiry]
"What's your downtime look like, Aria? Any unique hobbies outside of your ship work?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaPassionCooking]
"I've taken up cooking. I'm no chef, mind you. Half the time, it's more of an experiment than a meal. But there's something satisfying about creating with your hands, even if it's just a quirky sandwich."

[AriaPassionAmateurAstronomy]
"And I dabble in amateur astronomy. I’m not particularly great at it – I can barely tell the constellations apart! But gazing at the stars, not as a designer but just as myself, it's kind of liberating."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerPassionResponseEncouraging]
"Exploring new territories, even in the kitchen or the night sky. That's exciting, even if it's not about perfection."

[PlayerPassionResponseLightTease]
"Chef Aria and the star-gazer who can't find Orion? Sounds like you're enjoying the learning curve."

[PlayerPassionResponseUnderstanding]
"Those sound like great ways to unwind. It's not always about being the best, but enjoying the process."

[PlayerPassionResponseReflective]
"It’s good to hear you doing things just for the joy of it, not just for the end result. That’s important."

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaPassionResponseToEncouraging]
_Aria chuckles, a touch of self-deprecation in her tone._ "Exciting and a little humbling! But you're right, it's not about perfection. It's about the joy of trying, of creating."

[AriaPassionResponseToLightTease]
_Her laughter is genuine, tinged with a hint of embarrassment._ "Yeah, I'm embracing the 'amateur' in both! There's freedom in just being a novice, a learner. It's a nice change of pace."

[AriaPassionResponseToUnderstanding]
_She nods appreciatively, a reflective look in her eyes._ "Exactly. For so long, I've been driven by the need to excel. It's refreshing to do something just for the sheer enjoyment, even if I'm not the best at it."

[AriaPassionResponseToReflective]
_There's a moment of vulnerability in her expression._ "You've hit the nail on the head. I'm used to valuing time for productivity. Learning to value it just for the experience – that's new for me."# Scene 13: Hidden Passions
