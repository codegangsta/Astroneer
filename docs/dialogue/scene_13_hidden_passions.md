"Apart from crafting vessels for the stars, what else sparks excitement for you, Aria?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaPassionMusic]
"Melodies of old Earth. There's an authenticity in vintage tunes, a raw emotion. It's as vast and deep as space itself but in a way that touches the soul."

[AriaPassionSpeed]
"Oh! And the thrill of velocity. Whether it's a race in the atmosphere or a sprint through an asteroid field, it's that speed that makes me feel truly alive."

"That's an intriguing contrast to your day job. It's great to have passions that keep you grounded."

[PlayerPassionResponseIntrigued]
"Old tunes and high speeds, huh? Seems like you have a knack for things that defy time and gravity."

[PlayerPassionResponseTeasing]
"So, a need for speed and a heart for old ballads? You're full of surprises, Aria."

[PlayerPassionResponseChallenging]
"Music and racing, those are quite the escapes. Do they give you a break from the pressures of ship design?"

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaPassionResponseToAppreciative]
Aria: "Grounded, or maybe just keeping my sanity in the vastness of it all. Those passions remind me there's more to life than just metal and circuits."

[AriaPassionResponseToIntrigued]
Aria: "Defying the norm is what I do best, Cap. Why should my hobbies be any different? They're the fuel for my creative engine."

[AriaPassionResponseToTeasing]
Aria: "A woman of many layersâ€”that's me. Life's too short for one-dimensional characters, don't you think?"

[AriaPassionResponseToChallenging]
Aria: "They're not just escapes; they're part of who I am. Racing and music, they help me find balance. They're my personal rebellion against the routine."
