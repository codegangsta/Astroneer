# Scene 15: Sacrifices

[SceneAriaSacrifice]
_In this scene, the player digs into the personal costs of Aria's career, prompting her to consider her choices and their repercussions, which allows for a multifaceted exploration of her character's depth and resilience._

[PlayerSacrificeInquiry]
Player: "Every big leap comes at a cost. What's been yours in reaching for the stars, Aria?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaSacrifice01]
"I've traded the possibility of a 'normal' life for this dream. You know, picket fences don't travel well in zero-G. As for relationships, they're tough when you're always moving at escape velocity."

[AriaSacrifice02]
"Simplicity is a luxury I gave up. These days, I find beauty in the complexity of a starship's schematics rather than in a quiet, simple moment."

## Player Response Options

[PlayerSacrificeResponseSympathetic]
"It takes a strong person to make those choices, Aria. But the stars are lucky to have you."

[PlayerSacrificeResponseInquisitive]
"Do you ever regret it? Trading stillness for the stars?"

[PlayerSacrificeResponsePhilosophical]
"There's a certain beauty in complexity too. Maybe it's just a different kind of simple life you've found."

[PlayerSacrificeResponseBlunt]
"Hard sacrifices. Just don't let your work become your only world."

## Aria's Follow-up Responses

[AriaSacrificeResponseToSympathetic]
"That means a lot, coming from you. Sure, it's tough sometimes, but then I see a ship I designed cutting across the cosmos, and I know I've chosen the right path."

[AriaSacrificeResponseToInquisitive]
"Regret's a tricky thing. It's like an asteroid field—you navigate through it, not dwell on it. I look back, but I don't stare."

[AriaSacrificeResponseToPhilosophical]
"I like that—beauty in complexity. Maybe I've been looking at it all wrong. It's not what I've given up; it's what I've gained in its place."

[AriaSacrificeResponseToBlunt]
"I hear you. There's a whole universe out there, and sometimes I forget to explore it beyond the blueprints. I'll try to remember that, thanks."
