# Scene 3: Player Accepts Contract

_Context: The player has accepted a mission from the mission board, and has walked over to the Atlas Astronautics intercom to speak with Aria. Aria greets the player, then the player chooses to ask about the contract they've just accepted. Based on the type of Ship contract, a randomly generated response from Aria will be chosen. The intent is to have enough dialog and variety that each mission feels fresh and new_

## Player Dialogue

[PlayerAcceptContract01]
“Any ships in need of a designer’s hand today?"

[PlayerAcceptContract02]
"Is there a new vessel for me to take under my wing?"

[PlayerAcceptContract03]
"Got a ship that needs some love?"

[PlayerAcceptContract04]
"I'm here for that contract—what's the assignment?"

[PlayerAcceptContract05]
"What's the latest ship on the roster?"

[PlayerAcceptContract06]
"Ready for a new project; what have you got?"

[PlayerAcceptContract07]
"Looking for a ship that could use a tune-up?"

[PlayerAcceptContract08]
"Heard about a ship needing a fix, is it mine to take?"

[PlayerAcceptContract09]
"What's the word on that new contract?"

## Aria's Response: Generic

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric01]
"Here she is, Cap. She's a canvas that's seen a few cosmic storms, but I know you'll turn her into a masterpiece."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric02]
"This ship's got a history, and with your touch, I bet she'll have quite the future."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric03]
"All yours. She might not look like much now, but I've seen your work. She's in good hands."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric04]
"Got a new project for you. She’s a bit of a relic, but there's plenty of life in her yet."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric05]
"This beauty's had her glory days—time to bring 'em back, don't you think?"

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric06]
"Take good care of her. I'm expecting this old ship to break some new ground once you're done."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric07]
"She's ready for your hangar. I’m eager to see this transformation—make her shine."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric08]
"Remember, it's not just about the specs. Give her some character, something that'll turn heads in the hangar."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric09]
"This contract's a big one. No pressure, but I'm pretty sure you're going to knock it out of the park."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric10]
"She’s served us well, and now it's time for a new chapter. I'm looking forward to your revisions."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric11]
"A bit of a fixer-upper, sure, but give her the time she deserves, and she'll fly true."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric12]
"I've done my part, now it's all you. She might be old, but there's still speed in those engines."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric13]
"She's in your capable hands now. Just remember, every great ship has a bit of its designer's soul in it."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric14]
"This ship's seen the edges of the galaxy, and now with your help, she'll see them once more. Excited to see where you take her, Cap."

[AriaAcceptContractGeneric15]
"It's not every day you get to refurbish a classic. Can't wait to see her after you work your magic."

## Aria's Response: Fighter Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractFighter01]
"That I do. Got a ship here with more tales of valor than a space opera. Ready to pen its next epic chapter?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter02]
"Right on the mark. There's a craft in the hangar that's got 'daredevil' written all over it. Just needs a co-author—preferably one who's good with a wrench."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter03]
"Absolutely, Cap. There's a vessel lined up that's as eager for adventure as a comet is for orbit. Shall we give it a plot twist?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter04]
"Indeed, there's a plucky ship awaiting your touch. It's got a spirit for the skirmish and a body that... well, that's where you come in."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter05]
"You heard correct. Got a ship that's been through the asteroid belt and back. Fancy turning its scars into stars?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter06]
"Yes, there's a speedster craving your attention. She's swift, but under your command? I bet she could outrun a shooting star."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter07]
"The intel's spot-on. A little bird—or should I say satellite—told me you've got a soft spot for the spirited types."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter08]
"News does fly faster than light. There's a craft here that's part dare, part dash, and entirely ready for an overhaul."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter09]
"Heard right, Cap. There's a vessel here that's been resting too long in the hangar shadows. Time to let it chase the sunlight, don't you think?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter10]
"Tuning into the grapevine, I see. Well, the rumors are true. There's a ship that's just yearning for a bit of that tactical genius."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter11]
"Sharp ears! Got a ship here that's all heart and ambition. It's got the guts; it just needs a bit of your glory."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter12]
"Good, Cap. There’s a vessel here with a few stories etched on its hull, waiting for a fresh chapter."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter13]
"You're right on target. There's a craft here dreaming of nebula races. How about we wake it up to reality?"

[AriaAcceptContractFighter14]
"Spot on. Docked in bay nine is a ship that’s been whispering for some TLC. It's practically drafting love letters to your toolkit."

[AriaAcceptContractFighter15]
"Bullseye, Cap. The ship you're about to meet has a need for speed and a penchant for stealth. Ready to be its partner in crime?"

## Aria's Response: Explorer Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer01]
"That I do. There's an explorer out there with a thirst for the unknown. Fancy charting some unexplored territories?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer02]
"You're bang on. I’ve got a vessel that’s seen more stars than a galactic map. She’s ready for a designer with a curious heart."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer03]
"Indeed, Cap. There's a research craft that’s been to the edge of the void and back—could use a visionary to expand its horizons."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer04]
"Absolutely. There's a ship here that's been whispering about distant galaxies. I think it's time someone listened."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer05]
"Right you are. There's an explorer in the hangar that's just brimming with potential. How about you unlock its secrets?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer06]
"You heard right. This vessel's got 'explorer' in its DNA, but it's looking for the right crew to decode it."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer07]
"You've got the right intel. This ship's an archive of adventure—just needs a new story. Think you're up to write it?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer08]
"Good news does indeed travel at warp speed. Got a research ship that's eager for a captain with a penchant for discovery."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer09]
"Spot on, Cap. There's a vessel that's ready to dive into the great cosmic library. Fancy being its librarian?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer10]
"You're in tune with the cosmic currents, I see. I’ve got a ship that's aching to unravel the mysteries of the universe."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer11]
"Sharp ears! This ship's ready to scan the frontiers—and with your help, who knows what secrets we'll uncover?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer12]
"Your sources serve you well. There's an explorer here that's been gathering dust when it should be gathering data."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer13]
"Indeed, there's a craft with a hull full of questions. I'm thinking you've got the answers."

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer14]
"Precisely. This ship's destiny is to pioneer the stars. Help it fulfill that destiny, will you?"

[AriaAcceptContractExplorer15]
"Spot on, Cap. There's a research vessel in the bay that's been dreaming of nebulas and quasars. Ready to make those dreams a reality?"

## Aria's Response: Hauler Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractHauler01]
"Got something special for you, Cap. There's a freighter that’s more than ready to flex its cargo muscles under your command."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler02]
"Indeed, I've got a hauler here with enough storage space to make a black hole jealous. Care to give it a spin?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler03]
"Absolutely, Cap. There's a vessel that's been hauling dreams. Time to upgrade it to haul stars, perhaps?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler04]
"You've got it. This freighter's looking to expand its horizons—maybe carry more than just cargo, if you catch my drift."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler05]
"That's right. There’s a hauler in the bay that's good at keeping secrets—like hidden compartments. Interested in a little show and tell?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler06]
"You heard correct. This big beauty's got a cargo hold that's crying out for adventure. Think you can chart its course?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler07]
"You're spot on. There's a freighter that’s just yearning for someone who can handle her... extensive assets."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler08]
"Good intel, Cap. I’ve got a hauler that could use a designers’s gaze. It's all loaded up with potential—and maybe some contraband charm."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler09]
"Heard right, Cap. There's a freighter here that's sturdy as an old space tavern tale. Ready to add a few chapters?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler10]
"You're in tune with the shipping lanes, I see. There's a hauler here that's robust, reliable, and just a bit rusty around the thrusters."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler11]
"Spot on. This vessel’s ready to carry the weight of worlds. Well, their goods, at least. Fancy being the one at the helm?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler12]
"Precisely. There's a freighter docked that's looking to up its game from asteroid hopping to planet skipping."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler13]
"Indeed, there's a hauler that's been around the block. Ready to turn it into the pride of the trade routes?"

[AriaAcceptContractHauler14]
"That I do. There's a vessel in the bay that’s perfect for a captain with a keen eye for commerce and cargo."

[AriaAcceptContractHauler15]
"Right on the mark. There's a freighter in the hangar that could use a bit of your entrepreneurial spirit. Shall we negotiate terms?"

## Aria's Response: Interceptor Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor01]
"Cap, there's a swift number in the bay that's all about the chase. Think you can catch her potential?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor02]
"You're just in time. Got an interceptor here that's faster than a comet's tail. Ready to make it even swifter?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor03]
"Indeed, there's a craft that's built for the rush. It's got speed to spare, but it's waiting for your go-ahead."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor04]
"Absolutely, Cap. There's a vessel that's been outrunning radio waves. Fancy tuning it to outpace light?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor05]
"Got a racer's dream on deck. It's sleek, it's fast, and with your help, it could be the first through the finish line of a wormhole."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor06]
"That's right. There’s an interceptor in the hangar that's almost too hot to touch. Think you can handle the heat?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor07]
"Spot on. This craft is more needle than ship, ready to thread through the cosmos at breakneck speed."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor08]
"You heard correct. This interceptor's just a few tweaks away from breaking the sound barrier—on silent mode."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor09]
"Good intel, Cap. There's a speedster that's been dying to stretch its wings. Ready to give it the runway?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor10]
"Heard right. There's a vessel here with engines that hum a tune of pure velocity. Care to conduct the symphony?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor11]
"Your sources are good, Cap. There's an interceptor here that's quick on the draw but could use a faster holster."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor12]
"Indeed, I've got a craft that whispers through space-time. It's almost as stealthy as it is quick. Almost."

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor13]
"Precisely. This interceptor’s sleek lines hide a beast under the hood. Ready to unleash it?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor14]
"Spot on, Cap. There’s a ship in the bay that’s begging to break free from the laws of physics. Fancy giving it a lesson in rebellion?"

[AriaAcceptContractInterceptor15]
"Right on the mark. Docked in bay seven is a vessel that’s practically vibrating with untapped speed. Let's turn that tremble into a tremor."

## Aria's Response: Luxury Ship Type

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury01]
"Cap, I've got a floating palace that's longing for a touch of your grandeur. Ready to make it fit for a sovereign of the stars?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury02]
"You've come at the right time. There's a luxury liner here with interiors that are crying out for a revamp. How about it?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury03]
"Indeed, there’s a vessel in the hangar that's more boutique hotel than ship. Fancy adding a few stars to its rating?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury04]
"Absolutely, Cap. I’ve got a ship that's designed for the high life—just needs an astroneer with your eye for elegance."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury05]
"That's right. There's a luxury craft here with the potential to turn heads from here to the edge of the galaxy. Interested in some high-class engineering?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury06]
"Spot on. This yacht whispers opulence, but I think you could make it sing. Ready to compose a symphony of splendor?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury07]
"You heard correct. There's a vessel that's all about the finer things in life—like faster-than-light travel in a velvet glove."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury08]
"Good news travels in style, it seems. There's a luxury ship here that's just a gemstone's throw away from perfection. Care to be its jeweler?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury09]
"Heard right, Cap. There's a cruiser in the hangar that's as lavish as they come—but with room for your signature flourish."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury10]
"You're in tune with the high life, I see. I’ve got a ship that's a marvel of comfort, just waiting for that extra touch of class."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury11]
"Sharp ears! This luxury liner's got all the amenities, but it could use a dash of your adventurous spirit."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury12]
"Your sources serve you well. There's a pleasure craft here that's been sunbathing in the dock too long. Ready to take her out?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury13]
"Indeed, there's a ship designed for the elite, but I think you could make it a legend of luxury."

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury14]
"Precisely. This vessel’s a crown jewel in need of a little polish. Ready to make it shine, Cap?"

[AriaAcceptContractLuxury15]
"Right on the mark. There's an opulent behemoth in the bay that’s dying to break its gilded chains. Shall we?"
