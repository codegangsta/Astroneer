# Scene 6 - Player's Background

[SceneAriaBackgroundInquiry]

[AriaBackgroundInquiry]
Aria: "So, Cap, what brings you to this neck of the galaxy? Fame? Fortune? Or just chasing the horizon?"

## Player Response Options

[PlayerBackgroundResponseAmbition]
"I'm here for the adventure, and the credits aren't bad either."

[PlayerBackgroundResponseKinship]
"Just like you, looking to make my mark out here."

[PlayerBackgroundResponseHorizon]
"The horizon's a good start. What's beyond that is what I'm after."

## Aria's Response

[AriaBackgroundResponseToAmbition]
Aria: "Adventure with a side of credits, huh? That's a combo I can respect. Just remember that out here, the adventure often spends the credits for you."

[AriaBackgroundResponseToKinship]
Aria: "Ah, a fellow dreamer and doer! There's plenty of marks to be made, and with the right ship, you'll carve your name among the stars."

[AriaBackgroundResponseToHorizon]
Aria: "Always one to aim for the stars and beyond, I see. Well, Cap, in this vast canvas of darkness, you're bound to find some light. Let's find it together, eh?"
