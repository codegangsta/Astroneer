Player: "Can you tell me more about yourself?"

[AriaBackgroundResponseDetailed]

"More about me? Well, let's see... I'm a product of the colonies. A tiny speck on the edge of the frontier that you won't find on any tourist brochure. My playground was a scrapyard, and my toys were defunct engine parts and retired circuit boards. My folks figured I'd be a mechanic, but I had my eyes on the stars and my mind on the ships that could reach them."

"So, I made it off-world, thanks to a scholarship at the New Atlantis Academy. It was my shot, my supernova break. I was going to build the future. But the future, I learned, is often drafted by committee in the big corporate shipyards, and they weren't interested in the wild ideas of a colony girl with stars in her eyes."

"But then, Atlas Astronautics happened. A startup with ambition and, more importantly, a willingness to gamble on a wildcard like me. They needed someone who could think outside the proverbial box—or ship, in this case. So I jumped ship—literally—and it's been a wild ride since."

"I'm not just building ships here. I'm building dreams—my dreams—into every hull, every thruster array. And sure, I miss the simplicity of home sometimes. The smell of ionized air after a rain, the sound of old engines ticking as they cool down at night. But here, in this bustling hub of innovation and chaos... this is where I can make a real difference. This is where I can create something that will soar beyond the next system."

"And when things get too serious, I just remind myself that no matter how advanced our tech gets, we're still a bunch of primates trying to figure out how to not crash into the nearest celestial body. It's grounding, in an anti-gravity sort of way."
