Player: "Can you tell me more about yourself?"

[AriaBackgroundResponseDetailed01]
"More about me? Well, let's see... I'm a product of the colonies. A tiny speck on the edge of the frontier that you won't find on any tourist brochure. The scrapyard was my playground, I dreamt of one day inventing something big and important, something that would propel humanity forward. My folks figured I'd be a mechanic, but I had my eyes on the stars and my mind on the ships that could reach them."

"So, I made it off-world, thanks to a scholarship at the University here. It was my shot, my big break. I was going to build the future. But the corporate shipyards weren't buying what a starry-eyed colony kid was selling."

"But then, Atlas Astronautics happened. A startup with ambition and, more importantly, a willingness to gamble on a wildcard like me. They needed someone who could think outside the proverbial box—or ship, in this case. So I jumped ship—literally—and it's been a wild ride since."

[AriaBackgroundResponseDetailed04]
"I'm not just building ships here. I'm building dreams—my dreams—into every hull, every thruster array. And yeah, I miss home sometimes, but this place... it's where I can make a real impact. It's where I belong."

[AriaBackgroundResponseDetailed05]
"And when things get too serious, I just remind myself that no matter how advanced our tech gets, we're still a bunch of primates trying to figure out how to not crash into the nearest celestial body. It's grounding, in an anti-gravity sort of way."

[AriaBackgroundResponseDetailed06]
"What else would you like to know?"
