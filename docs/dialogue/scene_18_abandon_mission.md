## Aria's Responses

"No problem, Cap! Not every ship is a perfect match. I'll find this one a new captain."

[AriaContractIncomplete02]
"I'm updating the mission board right now. Let's find you a project that's more your speed."

[AriaContractIncomplete03]
"Sometimes a detour is part of the journey. Let's get you on a path that feels right."

[AriaContractIncomplete04]
"Keep your chin up. Space is vast, and there's always something else out there for you."
