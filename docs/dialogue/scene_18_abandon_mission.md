Player: "Looks like I've hit a bit of a snag with this contract. Can we arrange something else?"

## Aria's Responses

[AriaContractIncomplete01]
"Hey, Cap! So, the contract's turning into a bit of a space odyssey, huh? No worries, we've all been there. Navigating the cosmic currents isn't always smooth sailing."

[AriaContractIncomplete02]
"I'll take that contract off your hands and find it a cozy new home. Maybe with someone who doesn't mind a bit of space turbulence."

[AriaContractIncomplete03]
"In the meantime, let's get you something more your style. I'm updating the mission board as we speak â€“ think of it as a fresh start, or a second launch!"

[AriaContractIncomplete04]
"Keep those spirits high, Cap. The galaxy's full of opportunities, and there's always a new adventure waiting just beyond the next asteroid belt."
