# Scene 2a: Aria Greets the player

_Context: The player has just accepted a mission from the mission board and has walked over to the Atlas Astronautics intercom to speak with Aria. Upon pushing the "Call button", Aria responds from the intercom._

_Note: This response is typically played after the introductory quest, so Aria has already been introduced to the player._

"Hey there, Cap! What ship are we tackling today?"

[AriaGreet02]
"Back for more? Let's see what's on the docket."

[AriaGreet03]
"Hello again! Ready to jump into another design?"

[AriaGreet04]
"Got a new ship on your mind? Let's hear it."

[AriaGreet05]
"Ah, the master shipwright returns. What's the plan?"

[AriaGreet06]
"Hey! What exciting project are we looking at today?"

[AriaGreet07]
"Welcome back! Any new adventures in ship design?"

[AriaGreet08]
"Hi there! What ship will we be shaping up today?"

[AriaGreet09]
"Ready for another round of shipbuilding?"

[AriaGreet10]
"Great to see you! What's our design mission this time?"

## Scene 2b: Aria Greets the Player (funny/bored) - Fresh Humor

[SceneAriaGreetFunny]

[AriaGreetFunny01]
"Hello from Aria's isolation station! If I start making spaceship noises, just go with it."

[AriaGreetFunny02]
"Atlas’s remote ship designer here, where my biggest debate is talking to the toaster or the TV. What’s your crisis?"

[AriaGreetFunny03]
"Day 47 in the apartment wilderness, and I've started assigning starship roles to my furniture. What can I do for you?"

[AriaGreetFunny04]
"Reporting from Fort Couch Cushion. If I don't design something soon, I might start crafting a spaceship out of pillows. Help?"

[AriaGreetFunny05]
"Aria’s remote work hub, where the space adventures are imaginary, but the boredom is real. Got any projects to save me?"

[AriaGreetFunny06]
"Hey, Cap! Ready to swap my solo monologue for some actual dialogue. What’s on the drawing board?"

[AriaGreetFunny07]
"Greetings from my personal space dock – also known as the living room. Let's brainstorm before I start chatting with the ceiling fan."

[AriaGreetFunny08]
"Stir-crazy ship designer Aria here, currently debating space ethics with my reflection. What's our mission?"

[AriaGreetFunny09]
"Shuttle commander of the S.S. Sofa at your service. Shall we embark on a design journey today?"

[AriaGreetFunny10]
"Aria, reporting from the homefront! I'm one cup of coffee away from teaching my plant astrophysics. What's on the agenda?"

[AriaGreetFunny11]
"Your trusty starship engineer, now doubling as an apartment explorer. Found anything interesting out there in the real world?"

[AriaGreetFunny12]
"Broadcasting live from Aria’s space station (aka my kitchen). Let's talk ships before I start making rocket ships out of cutlery."

[AriaGreetFunny13]
"Who's there? Oh, just me, Aria, chatting with the door again. Let's focus on something productive, shall we?"

[AriaGreetFunny14]
"Mission control (aka my window seat) to Cap. I'm ready for some actual work before I start mapping constellations in my coffee."

[AriaGreetFunny15]
"Welcome to Aria's interstellar talk show, where the guest list is... well, nonexistent. Let's make some spaceship magic!"
