# Scene 2a: Aria Greets the player

_Context: The player has just accepted a mission from the mission board and has walked over to the Atlas Astronautics intercom to speak with Aria. Upon pushing the "Call button", Aria responds from the intercom._

_Note: This response is typically played after the introductory quest, so Aria has already been introduced to the player._

[AriaGreet01]
"Ah, my favorite cosmic collaborator! What challenge are we tackling with our combined genius today?"

[AriaGreet02]
"Look who's traversed the stars to grace us with their presence! What interstellar intrigue are we unraveling today?"

[AriaGreet03]
"Salutations! Just in time for a fresh batch of cosmic conundrums. Ready to dive in?"

[AriaGreet04]
"Welcome! Our design deck awaits your esteemed input. Shall we make some magic?"

[AriaGreet05]
"Ah, the maestro of the schematics! What masterpiece shall we conjure up today?"

[AriaGreet06]
"Touchdown! Ready for a brainstorm, or is it a brain hurricane with you? Either way, it'll be epic."

[AriaGreet07]
"Captain of innovation at the helm! What's today's mission in the great blueprint yonder?"

[AriaGreet08]
"Hey there! Whether it's contracts or constellations, I'm ready if you are. What's first on the agenda?"

[AriaGreet09]
"Star traveler and design maverick! I've got ideas brewing that are hotter than a supernova. Care to taste?"

[AriaGreet10]
"Greetings! Let's blend your vision with my tech for another day of legendary ship crafting, shall we?"

[AriaGreet11]
"Welcome back to the forge of the future. Ready to hammer out some new legends?"

[AriaGreet12]
"Ah, the prodigal shipwright returns! The galaxy's canvas awaits your next stroke of brilliance."

[AriaGreet13]
"Step right up to the cosmic carousel! What fantastical ride shall we craft today?"

[AriaGreet14]
"Good to see you! The stars have aligned for some creativity. Let's not keep them waiting."

[AriaGreet15]
"Welcome, spacefarer! Got your gear? Good. I've got plans and a penchant for the extraordinary."

[AriaGreet16]
"Back for more galactic artistry? Excellent. Our design studio is a nebula of potential today."

# Scene 2b: Aria Greets the player (funny/bored)

_Context: Identical to the previous scene, but shows off even more of Aria's quirky side. Aria is suffering from boredom becuase Atlas Astronautics is currently under construction, keeping her away from the ship bays where she wants to be, and sequestered to her tiny New Atlantis apartment, where it's often just her and her radio receiver. She's obviously going a bit stir crazy._

[AriaGreetFunny01]
"Hello, you've reached Aria, your friendly neighborhood shipwright. If you hear snoring, just yell into the mic—I'm probably under a pile of blueprints dreaming of engines."

[AriaGreetFunny02]
"If you're hearing this, congrats! You've successfully hailed the most star-struck ship designer between here and Andromeda. Now, let's talk ships before I start talking to the furniture."

[AriaGreetFunny03]
"Aria’s interstellar answering service, star-date today! Press 1 for ship designs, press 2 for cosmic banter, or stay on the line to help me escape the black hole of boredom."

[AriaGreetFunny04]
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening]! Aria’s voice beaming to you from the depths of my design den—where the coffee's strong and the ideas are stronger. What's the buzz?"

[AriaGreetFunny05]
"You’ve reached Aria Collins: half-ship designer, half-space DJ. Spin that dial for tunes, or let's design ships that'll make the Kessel Run in record time."

[AriaGreetFunny06]
"Psst, it’s Aria. Quick, before my indoor plant becomes my new design assistant, tell me you've got something exciting for us to work on!"

[AriaGreetFunny07]
"Do you read me? This is Aria broadcasting live from the land of schematics and caffeine! Ready to transmit some electrifying ideas?"

[AriaGreetFunny08]
"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Nope, it's just me, Aria, stuck in my apartment waiting for your call. So, what spaceship are we going to conquer the universe with today?"

[AriaGreetFunny09]
"Hey, space cadet! I've resorted to making paper airplanes, so let's design something a bit more advanced, shall we?"

[AriaGreetFunny10]
"Aria here, reporting from my living room command center, featuring a couch that doubles as a makeshift cockpit. What's our flight plan for today?"

[AriaGreetFunny11]
"Greetings, Earthling! This is your favorite ship designer, Aria, speaking to you from the great beyond... of my apartment. Got any galactic news?"

[AriaGreetFunny12]
"Incoming transmission from Aria: I've officially named all my appliances after celestial bodies. So, what's our mission before I start talking to them about thruster mechanics?"

[AriaGreetFunny13]
"Knock knock. Who's there? Aria, stuck on the comms channel, waiting to unleash some cosmic creativity. Beam us up some fun, will you?"

[AriaGreetFunny14]
"Cap, this is Aria, your intergalactic pen pal. I've just about rearranged my furniture into a spaceship. How about we design the real deal instead?"

[AriaGreetFunny15]
"You’ve reached the one-woman spacecraft think tank. I’ve been floating in a sea of solitude here, so your voice is a welcome docking request!"
