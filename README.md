# Astroneer - Starship Manufacturing Tycoon

Embark on a journey of innovation and prestige in Starfield with Astroneer, the groundbreaking new mod that transforms you into a galaxy-renowned starship architect. This mod revolutionizes the game with fresh mechanics, captivating story developments, and dynamic gameplay experiences.

## Features

### Forge Your Path as a Starship Artisan

Astroneer introduces a new mission category to the mission boards: Ship Contracts. These radiant quests challenge you to customize starships to meet specific thematic criteria. Successful completion of a ship contract garners you credits, experience points, and more, fueling your rise to interstellar fame.

### Collaborate with Aria Collins and Atlas Astronautics

At the heart of these ship contracts is Atlas Astronautics, an emerging name in starship manufacturing and retrofitting. Journey through the Astroneer narrative and watch Atlas ascend from a fledgling company to a behemoth in the cosmos of ship production.

Meet Aria Collins, a new, fully voiced NPC who will guide you through your ship contract endeavors. Engage with the unfolding story to uncover Aria's past and her driving forces.

### Witness Your Masterpieces in Action

Upon fulfilling a ship contract, your stellar designs will appear across the universeâ€”be it in the void of space, docked at a trading post, or landed on a foreign planet. Whether you choose to purchase your creation, commandeer it, or engage in a bit of space piracy, remember that it was brought to life by your hands.

**Mission Packs** offer an API for crafting and integrating new ship contracts, requiring minimal papyrus scripting to implement. Below is a sample framework for a mission pack:

```
ScriptName MyAwesomeMissionPack

Astroneer:Pack:Mission[] Function Missions(Astroneer:Pack p) global

  Astroneer:Pack:Mission[] missions = new Astroneer:Pack:Mission[0]

  ;= Fighter 01 =================================================
  Astroneer:Pack:Mission m1 = new Astroneer:Pack:Mission
  m1.ID = "MP01_Fighter01"
  m1.Title = p.MissionTitleFighter01
  m1.Text = p.MissionTextFighter01
  m1.ShipTemplate = p.ShipTemplateFighter
  m1.ShipType = p.ShipTypeFighter
  m1.Difficulty = p.DifficultyTier1
  m1.RewardCredits = 100000
  m1.RewardXP = 250
  m1.Objective01 = p.ObjectiveMass
  m1.ObjectiveTarget01 = 2000
  m1.Objective02 = p.ObjectiveShieldHealth
  m1.ObjectiveTarget02 = 500
  m1.Objective03 = p.ObjectiveWeaponPowerEnergy
  m1.ObjectiveTarget03 = 6
  m1.Objective04 = p.ObjectiveWeaponPowerMissile
  m1.ObjectiveTarget04 = 6
  m1.Objective05 = p.ObjectiveWeaponPowerBallistic
  m1.ObjectiveTarget05 = 6
  missions.Add(m1)

  return missions

## FAQ

### Is Astroneer safe to install?

In short, yes. Astroneer has been meticulously crafted with a strong emphasis on safety and compatibility.

The mod does not modify or overwrite any existing scripts, records, or assets from the original Starfield game. Instead, Astroneer introduces entirely new code and records, significantly minimizing the risk of conflicts. This also means that Astroneer is relatively safe to uninstall mid-game, though it's still recommended to keep it installed for the duration of your playthrough.

The development of Astroneer utilized the most recent versions of SF1Edit and the Caprica script compiler for optimal stability.

However, it's important to note that modding for Starfield is still emerging, and this mod is part of that pioneering wave. While every precaution has been taken to ensure safety, as with any mod, there's always a small chance of unexpected issues arising.

### Upset that this wasn't in Starfield's vanilla experience?

It's understandable to feel passionate about the content of the games you love. If you find yourself frustrated, consider stepping away for a moment. A breath of fresh air and a change of scenery can do wonders.

Remember, expressing dissatisfaction won't change the game. Instead, why not use that passion constructively? Your energy could greatly contribute to enhancing this mod and the community's experience!

### How can I contribute to Astroneer?

Your involvement is what shapes the future of Astroneer. We're on the lookout for players who can test and offer insights on mission balance and overall gameplay.

Feedback is welcome through GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, or on Nexus Mods.

For those interested in a more hands-on role, such as mod authors looking to contribute directly to Astroneer's development, please initiate a conversation via GitHub Discussions. Let's collaborate to make something incredible!
